Summary:
Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a facility that enables a machine to 
request a service from another remote machine. This is done without the 
request for available services on a host.

--
Impact:
This may be an intelligence gathering activity that could be the prelude
to an attack against a vulnerable service on the host.

--
Detailed Information:
This RPC status request returns information pertaining to available RPC 
services running on a host. This is not an attack against a host by 
itself but may be an intelligence gathering activity in prelude to an 
attack against a vulnerable service running on a target host.

--
Affected Systems:
All machines running RPC services.

--
Attack Scenarios:
The attacker merely needs to request information about services being 
offered on a target machine using "rpcinfo" for example.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple

--
False Positives:
When seen on a local area network a legitimate rpcinfo request will 

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:
RPC services should not be available outside the local area network, 
filter RPC ports at the firewall to ensure access is denied to RPC 
enabled machines.

Disable all RPC services where not needed.
