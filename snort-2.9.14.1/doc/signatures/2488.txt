--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a buffer overflow 
associated with winzip's processing of certain MIME archive files. 

--
Impact:
A successful attack may permit a buffer overflow that allows the execution
of arbitrary code at the privilege level of the user running winzip.

--
Detailed Information:
Winzip is a program that is used for file compression on Windows hosts.
A buffer overflow exists when parsing specific header fields for certain 
MIME file types.  An overly long value passed to the Content-Disposition
name field may trigger the buffer overflow and allow the execution of 
arbitrary code in the context of the user running winzip.

--
Affected Systems:
Winzip 6.x, 7.x, 8.0, 8.1 SR-1, 8.1, Winzip 9.0 beta versions

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can entice a user to open a malformed MIME file that will
invoke winzip to process it, possibly causing a a buffer overflow 
and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code on the vulnerable host.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.
