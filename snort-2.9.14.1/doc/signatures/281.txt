--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to issue a Denial of 
Service (DoS) attack that causes some Ascend routers to reboot.

--
Impact:
Denial of Service. Traffic between network segments or between internal 
and external networks can be disrupted.

--
Detailed Information:
Some Ascend routers run configuration software that is able to locate 
other Ascend routers by broadcasting on UDP port 9 (discard).  This port
is listened on by the Java Configurator tool.  A packet with a specially
crafted payload can cause the routers to reboot.

--
Affected Systems:
	Lucent Ascend MAX Router 5.0 and previous
	Lucent Ascend Pipeline Router 6.0 and previous
	Lucent Ascend Pipeline Router 6.0 and previous


--
Attack Scenarios:
Ascend routers can be forced to reboot remotely without authorization.  
Since the offending packet is UDP (which is not connection oriented), 
the sending address can be easily spoofed.  

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.  An exploit is available.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
An upgrade is available from the manufacturer.  Filtering traffic to 
port 9 will also prevent this exploit.
