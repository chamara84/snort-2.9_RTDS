--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a vulnerability
associated with the web server of WhatsUp Gold.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a denial of service or a buffer overflow and
the subsequent execution of arbitrary code on a vulnerable server.

--
Detailed Information:
WhatsUp Gold is a Windows application that can be used to monitor the status
of a network and the availability and performance of servers.  A vulnerability
exists in the web server component of WhatsUp Gold that can cause a denial of
service or buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code on a
vulnerable server.  This can occur when an overly long value is passed to the
parameter "instancename" when invoking the _maincfgret CGI. It should be noted
that the web server is not enabled by default in WhatsUp Gold.

--
Affected Systems:
WhatsUp Gold 8.x.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can connect to a web-enabled WhatsUp Gold server and send
an overly long value to the "instancename" when calling _maincfgret,
possibly causing a denial of service or buffer overflow.

--
Ease of Attack:
Denial of service - simple, buffer overflow - harder.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.
