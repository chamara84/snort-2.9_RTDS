Sid:
2650

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known
vulnerability in a Oracle database implementation.

--
Impact:
Serious. Execution of arbitrary code may be possible. A Denial of
Service (DoS) condition may also be caused.

--
Detailed Information:

An attacker can attempt to connect to a database using an overly
long user name value. This can cause a buffer overflow, allowing
an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

If you are running Oracle on a Windows server, make sure that the
variable $ORACLE_PORTS is set to a value of "any".

--
Affected Systems:
       Oracle8, Oracle8i, and Oracle9i

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can attempt to connect to a database supplying the
user an overly long value.  The result could permit the
attacker to gain escalated privileges and run code of their
choosing.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Ensure the system is using an up to date version of the software and has
had all vendor supplied patches applied.
