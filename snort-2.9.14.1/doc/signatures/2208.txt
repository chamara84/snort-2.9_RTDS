--
Sid:
2208

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to access fom.cgi on an internal web server. This may indicate an attempt to exploit a cross-site scripting vulnerability in Faq-O-Matic.

--
Impact:
Arbitrary code execution, possible session hijack.

--
Detailed Information:
Faq-O-Matic is a CGI-based system that automates FAQ maintenance on a web server. Versions 2.712 and lower contain a cross-site scripting vulnerability where an attacker can craft a URL with malicious code in the "cmd" argument. If a legitimate user activates the URL, malicious code may be executed on the client computer with the security context of the web server.

--
Affected Systems:
Systems running or accessing Faq-O-Matic version 2.712 or lower.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker crafts a URL that, when activated by a legitimate user, obtains the session cookie. This can allow the attacker to pose as the user for the duration of the session.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. A proof of concept exists.

--
False Positives:
If a legitimate remote user accesses fom.cgi, this rule may generate an alert.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to Faq-O-Matic version 2.713 or higher. Upgrades are available at http://faqomatic.sourceforge.net.
