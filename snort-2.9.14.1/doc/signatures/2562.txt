Sid:
2562

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a vulnerability
associated with the server component of McAfee's ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO).

--
Impact:
A successful attack may permit an attacker to upload malicious code on
the ePolicy Orchestrator server that may subsequently deliver the
malicious code to ePolicy agents.

--
Detailed Information:
There is a problem with access authentication in McAfee's ePolicy Orchestrator
server.  This product is responsible for distributing packages and code to
ePolicy agents, making this a potentially widespread and damaging attack in
a network.  Because of a failure to authenticate credentials,
an attacker can perform administrator functions, such as file uploads, by
connecting the the ePO web server.  The malicious files may be pushed to
the ePO agents by the ePO Orchestrator.

--
Affected Systems:
McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator 2.5.0
McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator 2.5.1 before Patch 14
McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator 3.0 before Patch 4 for 2.0 SP2A

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can attempt to upload a malicious file using the web
server of the ePO Orchestrator. The file may be subsequently
pushed by the Orchestrator to ePO agents.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
If a valid administrator connects to the ePO server and uploads
files, the alert will trigger.

--
False Negatives:
If the ePO server listens on a port other than 81, no alert will
trigger.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.
