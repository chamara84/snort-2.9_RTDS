Corrective Action:

This is a particularly difficult Trojan to remove and should only be 
attempted by an experienced Windows Administrator.

Edit the system registry to remove the extra keys or restore a 
previously known good copy of the registry.

Affected registry keys are:

	[HKEY_CLASSES_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices]
	[HKEY_CLASSES_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run] 
	[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run]

Registry keys added are:

	"SysManager"="C:\\WINDOWS\\System\\Manager.exe"

Removal of the file Manager.exe is required. Also end the process 
Manager.exe.

A machine reboot may be required to clear the existing process from 
running in memory.
