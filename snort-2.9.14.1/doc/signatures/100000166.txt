Summary: 
This event is generated when a command is sent to an Oracle isqlplus instance 
which contains a command to halt the Oracle TNS listener service.

--
Impact:
Vulnerable Oracle servers may shut down their TNS listener service upon receipt 
of this command, making the database unavailable for normal use until it is 
restarted.

--
Detailed Information:
iSQLPlus is a web interface to the Oracle SQLPlus system. A wide range of 
commands may be sent to an Oracle server via this interface, including 
administrative commands. If a request is sent which contains a command to halt 
the TNS listener service, vulnerable versions of Oracle will execute the 
command, halting the service and denying service to legitimate users until the 
service is restarted.

--
Affected Systems:
Oracle 9i Standard Edition 9.0.2.4
Oracle 9i Personal Edition 9.0.2.4
Oracle 9i Enterprise Edition 9.0.2.4

--
Attack Scenarios:
A web browser may be used to exploit this vulnerability.

--
Ease of Attack:

browser.

--
False Positives:
Any time an authorized administrator chooses to shut down the TNS listener 
service via the iSQLPlus interface.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
