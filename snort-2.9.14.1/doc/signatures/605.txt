--
Sid: 605

--
Summary: 
This event is generated when a remote login attempt using rlogin fails.

--
Impact: 
Someone has tried to login using rlogin and failed

-- 
Detailed Information: 
This rule generates an event when a login failure message generated by rlogind is seen. rlogin is used on UNIX systems for remote connectivity and remote command execution.  

Multiple events may indicate that an attacker is attempting a brute force password guessing attack.

--
Attack Scenarios: 
An attacker finds a machine with rlogin service running and proceeds to guess the password remotely by connecting multiple times.

--
Ease of Attack: 
Simple, no exploit software required

--
False Positives: 
A legitimate user may generate an event by entering an incorrect password.

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action: 
Investigate logs on the target host for further details and more signs of suspicious activity

Use ssh for remote access instead of rlogin.
