2119

--
Summary:
This event is generated when a remote user uses the IMAP RENAME command
to send a suspiciously long string to port 143 on an internal server.
This may indicate an attempt to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability
in the IMAP RENAME command. This may also affect other IMAP implementations.

Impact:
Possible shell access on the IMAP server, leading to arbitrary code
execution. The attacker must have a valid IMAP account on the mail
server to attempt this exploit.

--
Detailed Information:
When a large amount of data is sent to a vulnerable IMAP server in the
RENAME command, a buffer overflow condition may occur. This can allow
the attacker to access the shell, where arbitrary code can be executed.
Note that this exploit can only be attempted by a user with a valid IMAP
account.

--
Affected Systems:
	University of Washington imapd versions 10.234 or 12.264. 

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker with an IMAP account on the server can send a sufficiently
long RENAME command to the IMAP server, creating a buffer overflow
condition. This can then allow the attacker to gain shell access on the
compromised server, possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary code.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploits exist, but the user must have a valid IMAP account on
the server.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.

Apply the appropriate patches for your operating system.

Check the host for signs of compromise.
