Rule:

--
Sid:
1341

--
Summary:
Attempted cc command access via web

--
Impact:
Attempt to compile a binary on a host.

--
Detailed Information:
This is an attempt to compiile a C or C++ source on a host. The cc
command is theGNU project's C and C++ compiler used to compile C and
C++ sourcefiles into executable binary files. The attacker could
possibly compilea program needed for other attacks on the system or
install a binaryprogram of his choosing.

--
Attack Scenarios:
The attacker can make a standard HTTP request that contains 'cc'in the URI.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple HTTP request.

--
False Positives:
Web sites using spaces in filenames that also contain the characters
"cc" may cause this rule to generate an event. For example, the URI
http://www.foo.com/bar/filecc here.htm will cause an event to be
generated.

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:

Webservers should not be allowed to view or execute files and binaries
outside of it'sdesignated web root or cgi-bin. This command may also
be requested ona command line should the attacker gain access to the
machine. Wheneverpossible, sensitive files and certain areas of the
filesystem shouldhave the system immutable flag set to prevent files
from being addedto the host. On BSD derived systems, setting the
systems runtimesecurelevel also prevents the securelevel from being
changed. (note: thesecurelevel can only be increased).
