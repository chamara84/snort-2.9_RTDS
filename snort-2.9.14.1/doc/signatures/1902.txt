Summary:
This event is generated when a remote attacker sends an IMAP LSUB
command with a malformed and overly long argument to an internal IMAP
server port. This may indicate an attempt to exploit a buffer overflow
vulnerability in the IMAP LSUB command.

--
Impact:
Possible shell access on the IMAP server, leading to arbitrary code
execution. The attacker must have a valid IMAP account on the mail
server to attempt this exploit.

--
Detailed Information:
When an LSUB command with an overly long argument is sent to a
vulnerable IMAP server, a buffer overflow condition may occur. This can
allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code from the command shell. Note
that this exploit can only be attempted by a user with a valid IMAP account.

--
Affected Systems:
	University of Washington imapd versions 10.234 or 12.264.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker with an IMAP account on the server can send a sufficiently
long LSUB command to the IMAP server, creating a buffer overflow
condition. This can then allow the attacker to gain shell access on the
compromised server, possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary code.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploits exist, but the user must have a valid IMAP account on
the server.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Apply the patch for your current version of imapd appropriate to your
operating system.
