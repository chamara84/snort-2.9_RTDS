Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a flaw in the
X Windows Font Service.

--
Impact:
Arbitrary code execution. Denial of Service.

--
Detailed Information:
Certain versions of XFS distributed with Sun's Solaris are vulnerable to
a remote buffer overflow. The Dispatch() routine within fs.auto does not
provide adequate bounds-checking.

--
Affected Systems:
	Sun Solaris 2.5.1 to 9 (Update 2)

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker must have access to tcp port 7100. The attacker can then 
either cause XFS to crash or run code as user "nobody".

--
Ease of Attack:
Difficult

--
False Positives:
None Known

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:
Disable XFS in the inetd configuration file (normally /etc/inetd.conf 
under line fs.auto).
