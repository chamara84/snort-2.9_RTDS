--
Summary:
Secure Shell (SSH) is used to remotely manage systems over encrypted TCP
sessions. This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit 
vulnerable versions of the SecureCRT SSH client.

--
Impact:
System compromize presenting the attacker with either the opportunity to
execute arbitrary code or crash the client.

--
Detailed Information:
Van Dyke Technologies SecureCRT is a client program that allows users to
connect to servers running the Secure Shell (SSH) daemon for remote 
access via an encrypted TCP session.

A flaw in the SecureCRT client may result in arbitrary code execution 
with the privileges of the user running the client.

A buffer overflow can be caused by a server sending an overly long 
identifier string when using the SSH-1 protocol.

--
Affected Systems:
	Van Dyke Technologies SecureCRT prior to version 4.0 beta 1

Not affected:
	Van Dyke Technologies SecureCRT versions 3.2.2, 3.3.4, 3.4.6 and 4.0 beta 3.

--
Attack Scenarios:
The attacker would need to send overly large SSH version 1 identifier 
string to cause the overflow.

Exploit scripts are available

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploits are available.

--
False Positives:
None Known

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.
