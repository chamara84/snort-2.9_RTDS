Rule:
--
Sid:
236

--
Summary:
This event is generated when a Stacheldraht handler probes for a Stacheldraht agent on the destination host.

--
Impact:
Severe. This indicates that a Stacheldraht handler may exist on the source host and an agent may exist on the destination host.

--
Detailed Information:
The Stacheldraht DDoS uses a tiered structure of compromised hosts to coordinate and participate in a distributed denial of service attack. 

There are "handler" hosts that are used to coordinate the attacks and "agent" hosts that launch the attack. A handler can discover if a particular host is a Stacheldraht agent by sending it an ICMP echo reply with an ICMP identification number of 668 and a string of "gesundheit!" in the payload.

--
Affected Systems:
Any Stacheldraht compromised host.

--
Attack Scenarios:
A handler may attempt to discover if the destination host is a Stacheldraht agent. A script named "gag" can be used to generate this communication for a defender or attacker to discover if a host is a Stacheldraht agent.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.  The gag script is freely available.

--
False Positives:
None Known.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

--
Corrective Action:
Perform proper forensic analysis on the suspected compromised host to discover the means of compromise.

Rebuild a confirmed compromised host.

Use a packet filtering firewall to block inappropriate traffic to the network to prevent hosts from being compromised.
