Sid: 
546

--
Summary: 
This event is generated when an attempt is made to navigate in an FTP session to a hidden directory name that begins with a space.

--
Impact: 
Unauthorized file storage.  An attacker may attempt to navigate on an FTP server to a directory name that begins with a space to list or store unauthorized files such as unlicensed software.

--
Detailed Information: 
An attacker may attempt to hide unauthorized files in a hidden directory name that begins with a space.   This hidden directory is hard to discover, permitting attackers to store unauthorized "warez" files, such as unlicensed or pirated software.

--
Affected Systems: 
FTP servers

--
Attack Scenarios: 
An attacker may navigate to the hidden directory name that begins with a space to list or store unauthorized files.

--
Ease of Attack: 
Simple

--
False Positives: 
It is remotely possible that an authorized directory exists with a name that begins with a space.

--
False Negatives: 
Hidden directories other than those with names that begin with a space may be used to store "warez" files.

--
Corrective Action: 
Assign restrictive permissions to all directories so unauthorized users cannot navigate or write to them.

Regularly monitor directories for sudden or drastic increased use of space.
