Sid:
1819

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempted connection is observed originating from outside the network to the management port to the Alcatel PBX Phone Switch.

--
Impact:
Remote access, denial of service, privilege escalation.  A successful attack may allow remote root access, shutdown of the device, or privlege escalation.

--
Detailed Information:
The Alcatel 4000 PBX Phone Switch allows remote management via port 2533. It has been reported that sending a payload of hexidecimal 000143 in the first packet after the three-way handshake to the management port allows access to the device.  There are known default usernames and passwords that, if not changed, will allow control of the device.  Additionally, if a remote user logs in with an account that belongs to the group "other", a shutdown may be performed.  And, improper assignment of permissions on sensitive directories may permit a user to overwrite files and possibly escalate privileges.

--
Affected Systems:
Alcatel 4400 PBX running real-time Chorus OS.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker may attempt to use this exploit to gain root access, shutdown the system, or escalate privilege from user to root.

--
False Positives:
