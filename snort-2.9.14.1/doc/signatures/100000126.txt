Sid: 
100000126

-- 
Summary: 
This event is generated when an attempt is made to overflow a buffer in the 
GoodTech Telenet server.

-- 

Impact: 
The affected server will be crashed, and remote code execution with the 
privileges of the user running the telnet server is possible.

--
Detailed Information:
If the GoodTech telnet server recieves 10,083 bytes before a newline, a buffer 
will be overflowed. If properly crafted data is sent, arbitrary code may be 
executed with the privileges of the user running the server. Note that the rule 
looks for 1,000 or more bytes before a newline, due to limitations which do not 
allow a search for the full number of bytes required for the exploit.
