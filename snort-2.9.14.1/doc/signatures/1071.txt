Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to get a .htpasswd file from an HTTP server.

--
Impact:
Serious. Although .htpasswd files cannot be accessed through the Apache HTTP service by default.

--
Detailed Information:
The Apache HTTP server provides an authentication mechanism using .htaccess files and .htpasswd files.

These files contain authentication information and encrypted passwords. However, older versions of Apache HTTPD for Windows systems the password might be stored in plaintext.

In the default configuration, Apache HTTP server blocks any attempt to access .htaccess or .htpasswd files.

--
Attack Scenarios:
The attacker could make a request to retrieve the .htpasswd file then use the information in it to launch a dictionary attack based on the usernames found.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. No exploit software required.

--
False Positives:
None known

--
False Negatives:
None known

--
Corrective Action:
The .htpasswd file should be stored in a location outside the DocumentRoot for the webserver.

The default configuration should include the following section to prevent access to .ht files:

<Files ~ "^\.ht">
    Order allow,deny
    Deny from all
</Files>

Ensure the passwords stored in .htpasswd are encrypted.
