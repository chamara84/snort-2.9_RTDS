--
Summary:
A zone transfer of records on the DNS server has been requested.

A successful zone transfer can give valuable reconnaissance about hostnames and IP addresses for the domain.

--
Impact:
Information leak, reconnaissance.  A malicious user can gain valuable 
information about the network.


--
Detailed Information:
Zone transfers are normally used to replicate zone information between 
master and slave DNS servers.  If zone transfers have not been 
restricted to authorized slave servers only, malicious users can attempt
them for reconnaissance about the network.  The content |00 00 FC| looks
for the end of a DNS query and a DNS type of 252 meaning a DNS zone 
transfer.

--
Affected Systems:
All versions of BIND.

--
Attack Scenarios:
A zone transfer might be a precursor to some kind of attack to gain 
reconnaissance.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple to perform using tools such as nslookup, dig, and host.


--
False Positives:
Legitimate zone transfers from authorized slave servers may cause this 
False positives may arise from TSIG DNS traffic.  If all of your slave 
servers are in your $HOME_NET and you do not support TSIG, the 
likelihood of false positives should be very low.


--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:
Configure your DNS servers to allow zone transfers from authorized hosts
only.
