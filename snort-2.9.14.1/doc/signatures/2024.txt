Summary:
A vulnerability exists in Solaris snoop such that a remote attacker 
could gain superuser access when used with the RPC service rquotad

--
Impact:
Remote super user access leading to a compromise of the target machine 
along with any network resources that machine is connected to.

--
Detailed Information:
Certain versions of the Solaris operating system use a program to
monitor network traffic called Snoop. This program contains a flaw such
that under certain conditions a buffer overflow can be caused by a 
remote attacker.

One such condition occurs when snoop tries to decode GETQUOTA requests
to the RPC service rquotad. This daemon sends information regarding disk
quotas on multi-user systems using remotely mounted shares via NFS. A
specially crafted long request will trigger this overflow resulting in
root access on the victim host.

--
Affected Systems:
	Sun Solaris 2.4 _x86
	Sun Solaris 2.4
	Sun Solaris 2.5 _x86
	Sun Solaris 2.5
	Sun Solaris 2.5.1 _x86
	Sun Solaris 2.5.1 _ppc
	Sun Solaris 2.5.1
	Sun Solaris 2.6 _x86
	Sun Solaris 2.6
	Sun Solaris 7.0 _x86
	Sun Solaris 7.0

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can send a specially crafted long request to snoop via the 
rpc.rquotad service such that it will generate a buffer overflow.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple although a requirement is that snoop should be running at the 
time of attack.

--
False Positives:
None Known

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:
Patches are available for all operating systems and platforms listed as
affected from Sun. These patches should be applied as soon as possible.
