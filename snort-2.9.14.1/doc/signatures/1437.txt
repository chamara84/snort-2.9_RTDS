Sid:
1437

--
Summary:
This event is generated when network traffic indicating the use of a
multimedia application is detected.

--
Impact:
This may be a violation of corporate policy since these applications can
be used to bypass security measures designed to restrict the flow of
corporate information to destinations external to the corporation.

--
Detailed Information:
Multimedia client applications can be used to view movies and listen to
music files. Some also include file sharing facilities. Use of these
programs may constitute a violation of company policy.

Clients may also contain vulnerabilities that can give an attacker an
attack vector for delivering Trojan horse programs and viruses.
