Sid:
238

--
Summary:
This event is generated when a Tribe Flood Network (TFN) Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) daemon responds to a client request to spawn a shell.

--
Impact:
Attempted DDoS.  If the listed source IP is in your network, it may be a TFN daemon.  If the listed destination IP is in your network, it may be a TFN client.

--
Detailed Information:
The TFN DDoS uses a tiered structure of compromised hosts to coordinate and participate in a distributed denial of service attack. Clients communicate with daemons to inform them to launch attacks. A daemon will respond with a client request to spawn a shell with an ICMP echo reply with an ICMP identification number of 123, an ICMP sequence number of 0 and a string of "shell bound to port" in the payload.   

--
Affected Systems:
Any TFN compromised host.

--
Attack Scenarios:
After a host becomes a TFN daemon, it will respond to client requests.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. TFN code is freely available.

--
False Positives:
None Known.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

--
Corrective Action:
Perform proper forensic analysis on the suspected compromised host to discover the means of compromise.

Rebuild a confirmed compromised host.

Use a packet-filtering firewall to block inappropriate traffic to the network to prevent hosts from being compromised.
