2564

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a vulnerability
associated with the Symantec Firewall.

--
Impact:
A successful attack may cause a buffer overflow, permitting the execution
of arbitrary code on the vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
There is a vulnerability in the way the Symantec Firewall handles NetBIOS
Name Service response packets.  If an attacker crafts a malicious UDP NetBIOS
Name Service unsolicited response to a vulnerable Symantec Firewall that does
not block port 137, it is possible to cause a buffer overflow and execute
abitrary code with kernel privileges.  The vulnerability exists because of
improper validation of the length field value for the NetBIOS name returned.
The default configuration does not allow UDP port 137 traffic and should
not be exploitable if UDP port 137 is blocked.
