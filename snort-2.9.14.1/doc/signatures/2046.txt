Summary:
The IMAP daemon distributed by Washington University (Wu-imapd) is
subject to a buffer overflow condition which may result in a denial of service.

--
Impact:
Possible code execution and Denial of Service.

--
Detailed Information:
If a valid user of an IMAP service using wu-imapd makes a partial
request of mailbox attributes, a buffer overflow occurs in the daemon
resulting in the crash of the process.

Execution of arbitrary code may be possible with the privileges of the
user running imapd.

Exploits are widely available for this vulnerability.
