Sid:
100000690
--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit an SQL injection 
vulnerability in the "BXCP" application running on a webserver. Access to the 
file "index.php" with SQL commands being passed may indicate that an 
exploitation attempt has been attempted. 

--
Impact:
Information gathering and system integrity compromise. Possible unauthorized 
administrative access to the server or application. Possible execution of 
arbitrary code of the attackers choosing in some cases.

--
Detailed Information:
This event indicates that an attempt has been made to inject SQL code from a 
remote machine via the "index.php" script used by the "BXCP" application 
running on a webserver.

If stringent input checks are not performed by the CGI application, it may also 
be possible for an attacker to compromise the database backend for the 
application, the attacker may also be able to execute system binaries or 
malicious code of their choosing.

This event is generated when an attempt is made to gain unauthorized access to 
a CGI application running ona web server. Some applications do not perform 
stringent checks when validating the credentials of a client host connecting to 
the services offered on a host server. This can lead to unauthorized access and 
possibly escalated privileges to that of the administrator. Data stored on the 
machine can be compromised and trust relationships between the victim server 
and other hosts can be exploited by the attacker.

--
Affected Systems:
All systems running BXCP version 0.3.0.4 and prior.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can inject SQL commands to the backend database for an application 
if user input is not correctly sanitized or checked before passing that input 
to the database.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploits exist.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Currently, no patches or workarounds exist.
