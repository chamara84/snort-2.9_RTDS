--
Summary:
file on a Lotus Domino Server.

--
Impact:
Information disclosure

--
Detailed Information:
Certain versions of Lotus Domino web servers do not correctly handle 
requests for script files not specific to Lotus Domino.

By using a dot in the filename an attacker may view the source of the 
script and be presented with sensitive information embedded in the 
script.

--
Affected Systems:
Lotus Domino Server 5.0 and 6.0

--
Attack Scenarios:
The attacker merely needs to make an HTTP request for the script and add
a dot to the filename. This can be done using a browser.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple

--
False Positives:
The HotSaNIC (hotsanic.sourceforge.net) System and Network Info Centre
can graph the occurence of worm attacks on a server against time. The
HotSaNIC system displays 'WEB-MISC Lotus Notes .exe script source
download attempt' type attacks in an image file called
thumb-root.exe.gif. Each time this image is accessed it generates an
event.

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:
Apply the appropriate vendor fixes

Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software
