Summary:
The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) daemon is used to issue 
dynamic IP addresses from a server to client machines. A vulnerability 
exists such that arbitrary code may be executed on the server using the 
credential of the super user (root).

--
Impact:
Execution of code and possible control of the targeted machine.

--
Detailed Information:
A format string vulnerabilty in some versions of dhcpd may lead to the 
execution of arbitrary code as the root user via a DNS server response. 
This is due to the unsafe logging of user data. The option NSUPDATE 
option in the configuration of dhcpd must be enabled, although this is a
default option in version 3.0 and later.

Two exploits for this vulnerability are known to exist.
