Sid:
2217

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to access printmail.cgi on an internal web server. This may indicate an attempt to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in Ipswitch IMail 7.04 and earlier.

--
Impact:
Denial of service.

--
Detailed Information:
Ipswitch IMail is a mail server that supports multiple mail protocols. Its web mail implementation contains a vulnerability in printmail.cgi where, if a mailbox name with more than 248 dot characters (.) is requested, the service will crash. It has also been reported that this is caused by a buffer overflow error that may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, but this has not been confirmed.

--
Affected Systems:
Mail servers running Ipswitch Imail 7.04 and earlier with web mail enabled.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker sends an HTTP request to printmail.cgi for a mailbox with more than 248 dot characters in the mailbox name parameter. The mail server will crash and must be restarted.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
If a legitimate remote user accesses readmail.cgi, this rule may generate an event.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to a newer version or apply the vendor-supplied hotfix available at ftp://ftp.ipswitch.com/Ipswitch/Product_Support/IMail/imail704.exe.
