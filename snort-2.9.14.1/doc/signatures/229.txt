Sid:
229

--
Summary:
This event is generated when a Stacheldraht agent attempts to contact a known handler.

--
Impact:
This indicates that a Stacheldraht agent may exist on the source host and a handler may exist on the destination host.

--
Detailed Information:
The Stacheldraht DDoS uses a tiered structure of compromised hosts to coordinate and participate in a denial of service attack.  

There are "handler" hosts that are used to coordinate the attacks and "agent" hosts that launch the attack.  Once a host becomes a Stacheldraht agent, it will attempt to contact a list of known handlers using an ICMP echo reply with an ICMP identification number of 666 and a string of "skillz" in the payload. 

--
Affected Systems:
Any Stacheldraht compromised host.

--
Attack Scenarios:
A compromised host that has become a Stacheldraht agent will attempt an initial communication with all known handlers.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Stacheldraht code is freely available.

--
False Positives:
None Known.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

--
Corrective Action:
Perform proper forensic analysis on the suspected compromised host to discover the means of compromise.

Rebuild a confirmed compromised host.

Use a packet filtering firewall to block inappropriate traffic to the network to prevent hosts from being compromised.
