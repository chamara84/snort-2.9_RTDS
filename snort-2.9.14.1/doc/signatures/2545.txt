AFPName is longer than the declared length, the buffer will be
overflowed and may present an attacker with the opportunity to execute
code of their choosing.

Attack Scenarios: 
An attacker can supply an AFPName longer than what is expected by the
service and overwrite portions of memory leading to the execution of
code.
