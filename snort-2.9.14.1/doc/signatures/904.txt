Rule:

--
Sid:
904

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to access an Example 
application on a Coldfusion 4.x server. 

--
Impact:
Serious. The vulnerability is not limited to files in the webspace, so 
system files or additional unexecuted code files could be retrieved and 
examined for vulnerabilities.

--
Detailed Information:
ColdFusion (Macromedia, formerly Allaire) web servers have several 
default Example applications installed that have vulnerabilities.  The 
email application can be exploited to allow remote viewing of arbitrary 
files.

--
Affected Systems:
ColdFusion versions 4.0 thru 4.5 (4.5.1 is not vulnerable), on all 
supported platforms

--
Attack Scenarios:
The file at cfdocs/exampleapp/email/application.cfm includes a page,
cfdocs/exampleapp/email/getfile.cfm, that can accept URL-mangled 
requests like:

http://www.server.com/cfdocs/exampleapp/email/getfile.cfm?filename=c:\boot.ini

This allows trivial remote retrieval of any file on the server.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
If ColdFusion 4.x's example code is being used, This rule will generate 
an event.

--
False Negatives:
None known

--
Corrective Action:
Delete all example code.  This is one of several significant 
vulnerabilities that are exploitable if the example code is left on a 
production server.
