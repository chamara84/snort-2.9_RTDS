Rule:

--
Sid:
804

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a buffer 
overflow vulnerability in SWSoft ASPSeek search engine software.

--
Impact:
Arbitrary code execution.

--
Detailed Information:
SWSoft ASPSeek search engine software contains a buffer overflow 
vulnerability where, if a sufficiently long string is sent to the s.cgi 
script using the template (tmpl) variable, a buffer overflow condition 
can occur. This may allow the execution of arbitrary code. 

--
Affected Systems:
All Apache web servers running SWSoft ASPSeek 1.0.3 and earlier are 
vulnerable.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can send a crafted query to the s.cgi script, creating a 
buffer overflow condition. This could then allow the attacker to execute
arbitrary code from the system's command shell.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploits exist.

--
False Positives:
If a legitimate remote user accesses s.cgi where the "tmpl" variable is 
invoked, this rule may generate an event.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to SWSoft ASPSeek 1.04 or later.
