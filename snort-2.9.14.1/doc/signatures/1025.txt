Sid:
1025

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a potential 
weakness on a host running Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS). 

--
Impact:
Information gathering possible administrator access.

--
Detailed Information:
This event indicates that an attempt has been made to exploit potential 
weaknesses in a host running Microsoft IIS.

This event indicates that an attempt has been made to access
/scripts/perl on a web server. This may indicate that an attacker is
attempting to run code of their choosing on that server.

Perl should not be installed in a directory directly accessible via the
Internet on a web server.

--
Affected Systems:
	Any host using IIS with Active Perl installed.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can retrieve a sensitive file containing information on the 
IIS implementation. The attacker might then gain administrator access to
the site, deface the content or gain access to a database.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
Access to a webserver that stores web cgi scripts in /scripts/perl/ will
generate events.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

--
Corrective Action:
Check the IIS implementation on the host. Ensure all measures have been 
taken to deny access to sensitive files.

Ensure that the IIS implementation is fully patched.

Ensure that the underlying operating system is fully patched.

Employ strategies to harden the IIS implementation and operating system.

Check the host for signs of compromise.
