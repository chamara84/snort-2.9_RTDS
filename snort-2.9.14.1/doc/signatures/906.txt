Rule:

--
Sid:
906

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to access an Example 
application on a Coldfusion 4.x server. 

--
Impact:
Serious. The vulnerability is not limited to files in the webspace, so
system files or additional unexecuted code files could be retrieved and
examined for vulnerabilities.

--
Detailed Information:
ColdFusion (Macromedia, formerly Allaire) web servers have several
default Example applications installed that have vulnerabilities.  The
email application can be exploited to allow remote viewing of arbitrary
files.


--
Affected Systems:
	ColdFusion versions 2.x, 3.x, 4.x for Windows
	ColdFusion versions 4.x for Solaris, HP-UX
	ColdFusion versions 4.5.x for Linux

--
Attack Scenarios:
The example application file cfdocs/exampleapp/email/getfile.cfm can 
accept URL-mangled requests like:

http://www.server.com/cfdocs/exampleapp/email/getfile.cfm?filename=c:\boot.ini

This allows trivial remote retrieval of any file on the server.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
If ColdFusion 4.x's example code is being used, This rule will generate 
an event.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Delete all example code.  This is one of several significant
vulnerabilities that are exploitable if the example code is left on a
production server.
