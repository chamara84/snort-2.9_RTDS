--
Sid:
2576

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known 
vulnerability in a Oracle database implementation.

--
Impact:
Serious. Execution of arbitrary code may be possible. A Denial of
Service (DoS) condition may also be caused.

--
Detailed Information:
Oracle databases may use an inbuilt procedure to generate triggers
needed for database replication. The "generate_replication_support"
procedure contains a programming error that may allow an attacker to
execute a buffer overflow attack.

This overflow is triggered by long strings in some parameters for the
procedure.

Oracle servers running on a Windows platform may listen on any arbitrary
port. Change the $ORACLE_PORTS variable in snort.conf to "any" if this
is applicable to the protected network.

--
Affected Systems:
	Oracle 9i

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can supply a long string to either the "package_prefix" or
"procedure_prefix" variables to cause the overflow. The result could
permit the attacker to gain escalated privileges and run code of their
choosing.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Ensure the system is using an up to date version of the software and has
had all vendor supplied patches applied.
