Rule:

--
Sid:
100000686

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an empty CTCP NOTICE message is sent to an IRC 
channel.

--
Impact:
If the EnergyMech IRC Bot receives such a message, a denial of service 
condition will occur.

of service condition occurs. Note that this rule is set to examine only default 
IRC ports, in order to conserve system resources; if you are particularly 
concerned about this exploit, you may wish to set the ports to "any", as IRC 
channels can exist on any port.
