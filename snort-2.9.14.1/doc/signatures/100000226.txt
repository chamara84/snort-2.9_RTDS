--
Sid:
100000226

--
Summary:
This event is generated when a host connected to the Internet is first infected 
with the BlackWorm/Nyxem virus.

--
Impact:
The system generating the alert has likely been infected with the 
BlackWorm/Nyxem virus.

--
Detailed Information:
When a system is first infected with the BlackWorm/Nyxem virus, the malicious 
program attempts to access 
http://207.172.16.155/cgi-bin/Count.cgi?df=76547 in order to report a 
successful installation. Numerous sources, including the Sourcefire VRT, have 
confirmed that this URL is static.

--
Affected Systems:
All Windows systems.

--
Attack Scenarios:
The virus may arrive by e-mail, in which case a user must execute the file in 
order to be infected. Once infected, hosts conduct NetBIOS scans and attempt to 
infect other hosts via publicly accessible shares; in this method, no user 
interaction is required.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple

--
False Positives:
Any user who directs a web browser to 
http://207.172.16.155/cgi-bin/Count.cgi?df=76547 will trigger this rule.

--
False Negatives:
Hosts without Internet access which become infected (i.e. by another infected 
system on their local network) will not trigger this rule until they connect to 
the Internet, as they will be unable toaccess this web page.

--
Corrective Action:
Several antivirus vendors have detection and removal capabilities. 
Additionally, Microsoft has detailed instructions for manual removal on their 
web site.
