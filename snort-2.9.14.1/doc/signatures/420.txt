Rule:

--

Sid:
420

--

Summary:
This event is generated when a network host generates an ICMP Mobile Host Redirect datagram with an undefined ICMP code.

--

Impact:

Undefined ICMP Code values should never be seen on the network.  This could be an indication of nefarious activity on the network.

--

Detailed Information:
The Transparent Internet Routing for IP Mobile Hosts IETF draft defines ICMP Type 32 Code 0 as an ICMP Mobile Host Redirect Message.  This message was intended to be used by mobile computers to inform base-stations of their location on the network as they move from base-station to base-station.  In normal situations the ICMP Code should be set to 0, values other than 0 are undefined and should never be used.

This IETF draft was never ratified, and no hardware is known to exist that generates this type of ICMP datagram

--

Attack Scenarios:
None known

--

Ease of Attack:
Numerous tools and scripts can generate this type of ICMP datagram.

--

False Positives:
None known

--

False Negatives:
None known
--

Corrective Action:
ICMP Type 32 datagrams are not normal network activity.  Hosts generating these types of datagrams should be investigated for nefarious activity
