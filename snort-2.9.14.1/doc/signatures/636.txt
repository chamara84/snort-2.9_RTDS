Summary:
This event is generated when a scan is detected. 

--
Impact:
Information gathering.

--
Detailed Information:
This event indicates that an attempt has been made to scan a host.

This may be the prelude to an attack. Scanners are used to ascertain 
which ports a host may be listening on, whether or not the ports are 
filtered by a firewall and if the host is vulnerable to a particular 
exploit.

--
Affected Systems:
Any host.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can determine if ports 21 and 20 are being used for FTP. 
Then the attacker might find out that the FTP service is vulnerable to a
particular attack and is then able to compromise the host.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
A scanner may be used in a security audit.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

--
Corrective Action:
Determine whether or not the scan was legitimate then look for other 
events concerning the attacking IP address.

Check the host for signs of compromise.
