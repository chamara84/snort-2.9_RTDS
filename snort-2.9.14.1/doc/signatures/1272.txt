Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to probe a host for the
sadmind RPC service.

--
Impact:
Information gathering.

--
Detailed Information:
Certain versions of sadmind on Solaris systems are vulnerable to a
remotely exploitable buffer overflow condition. This event indicates
that an attempt has been made to determine if the service is available
on the target host.

--
Affected Systems:
	Solaris 2.5 through 2.7
 
--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker runs an automated tool that connects to portmapper of the
target host, probes for RPC, and repeatedly attacks the host to brute
force the offset in the buffer overflow.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Tools are available and exploit code exists to exploit
vulnerabilites in sadmind.

--
False Positives:
None Known

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:
Disable the sadmind service.

Disallow access to RPC services from hosts external to the protected
network
