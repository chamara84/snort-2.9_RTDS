Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit 
vulnerable versions of the Kerberos version 4 administration daemon 
(kadmind).

--
Impact:
Serious. System compromize presenting the attacker with the opportunity to execute arbitrary code or gain unauthorized access to the target host along with other hosts in the kerberos realm.

--
Detailed Information:
kadmind is used to administer a Kerberos database on the master key distribution center (KDC) of a kerberos realm.

A buffer overflow condition exists in kadmind4 such that when the daemon parses a length value in an administration request the attacker can gain the ability to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the daemon, usually root.

Authentication is not required to cause the overflow.

Affected Systems:
	Multiple vendors using kadmind version 4

--
Attack Scenarios:
Exploit scripts are available

--
Ease of Attack:

--
False Positives:
