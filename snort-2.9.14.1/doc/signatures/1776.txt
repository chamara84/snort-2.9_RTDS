Attack Scenarios: 
A MySQL implementation may inappropriately respond to connections from any host external to the protected network. The atttacker may be able to query the daemon to gain a list of databases available, then continue to garner information from the databases.

-- 

False Positives: 
This event may be generated by a legitimate user making a query to a MySQL daemon from an external source.
