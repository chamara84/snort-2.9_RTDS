Summary:
Attempted chmod command access via web

--
Impact:
Attempt to change file permissions on a webserver.

--
Detailed Information:
This is an attempt to change file permissions on a machine. Using this
command an attacker may change the permissions of a file to suit his own
needs, make a file readable, writeable or excutable to other groups and
users that wouldotherwise not have these special permissions.

--
Attack Scenarios:
The attacker can make a standard HTTP request that contains '/bin/chmod'
in the URI whichcan then change file permissions of files present on
the host.Thiscommand may also be requested on a command line should
the attacker gainaccess to the machine.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple HTTP request.

--
False Positives:
None Known

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:

Webservers should not be allowed to view or execute files and binaries
outside ofit's designated web root or cgi-bin.Whenever possible,
sensitive files andcertain areas of the filesystem should have the
system immutable flagset to negate the use of the chmod command. On
BSD derived systems,setting the systems runtime securelevel also
prevents the securelevelfrom being changed. (note: the securelevel can
only beincreased)
