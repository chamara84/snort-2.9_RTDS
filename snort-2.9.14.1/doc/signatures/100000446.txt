validation on the version variable used in the index.php component.

--
Impact:

a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input before
using it in an SQL query. 

A successful exploit could allow an attacker to compromise the application,
access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database
implementation.

Attack Scenarios:
Variable manipulation can be done with any browser.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
