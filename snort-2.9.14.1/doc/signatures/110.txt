Summary:
Netbus is a Trojan Horse.

--
Impact:
Possible theft of data and control of the targeted machine. This Trojan also has the ability to scan machines and networks for open ports, it can also redirect legitimate traffic to other destinations. It can turn the infected host into an open proxy server.

--
Detailed Information:
This Trojan affects the following operating systems:

	Windows 95
	Windows 98
	Windows ME
	Windows NT
	Windows 2000
	Windows XP

The Trojan changes system registry settings to add the Netbus sever to programs normally started on boot. Due to the nature of this Trojan it is unlikely that the attacker's client IP address has been spoofed.

Corrective Action:

The manual removal of this Trojan should only be attempted by an experienced Windows system administrator.

Edit the system registry to remove the extra keys or restore a previously known good copy of the registry.

Affected registry keys are:

	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices\
	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

Registry keys added include:

	Netbus Server Pro
	PATCH "C:\windows\patch.exe /nomsg" - note: the entry may not necessarily be called PATCH
	NetBuster = ""
	SysCopy = "command /c copy %windir%\\keyhook.dl_ %windir%\\*.dll /Y"
	Rundll32 = "rundll.dl_ /noadd"
	Rundll = "regedit /s nbsetup2.reg"

Later versions may also add one of these registry entries:

	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/UltraAccess Networks/NetBus Server/
	HKEY_CURRENT_USER/NetBus Server/

These entries should be deleted.

The files rundll.dl_ (note the underscore, this is important) and nbsetup2.reg should be deleted if they exist.

Ending the process is necessary. A reboot of the infected machine is recommended.
