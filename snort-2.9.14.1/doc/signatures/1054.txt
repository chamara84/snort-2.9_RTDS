1054

--

Summary:
Someone attempted to gain unauthorized access to web application source code
through a BEA WebLogic Server or Apache Tomcat JSP vulnerability.

--
Impact:
An attacker may have been able to read the source code to a web application.
Sometimes web application source code contains highly sensitive information,
such as database passwords and information concerning backend setups.  This
could be a prelude to further attacks.

--
Detailed Information:
Some versions of BEA WebLogic and Apache Tomcat web servers contain
vulnerabilities that can allow an attacker to read the source code to
web applications.

--
Affected Systems:
 
--
Attack Scenarios:
Attacker sends a simple URL like the following:
http://www.example.com/index.js%70

--
Ease of Attack:
Very simple handcrafted URL.

--
False Positives:
None Known

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:
Examine the packet to see if a web request was being done.  Try to
determine what the requested file was, and determine
from the web server's configuration whether it was a threat or not
(e.g., whether the requested file even existed and whether the web
server was vulnerable to such attacks).
