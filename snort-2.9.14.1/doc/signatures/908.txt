Rule:

--
Sid:
908

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to access the 
administrator screens for Coldfusion server.  A long password can cause 
a Denial-of-Service.

--
Impact:
Denial of Service (DoS). While the risk as a target for password attacks is minor, the administrator login mechanism can be jammed by long passwords, leading to a DoS for the server.

--
Detailed Information:
ColdFusion's administrator interface is reachable via:

http://www.target.com/CFIDE/administrator/index.cfm

It is recommended that access to these pages be restricted to trusted 
IP addresses to prevent them being targets for password attacks.

Further, long passwords create a Denial-of-Service state in the server 
temporarily.

See Macromedia Security Bulletin (MPSB01-08) for complete information.

--
Affected Systems:
ColdFusion versions 4.x for Windows, Solaris, HP-UX, Linux

--
Attack Scenarios:
The attacker can access the administration interface for the server and 
gain control of the application.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known

--
False Negatives:
None known

--
Corrective Action:
At minimum, restrict access to the administrator mechanism from within 
the ColdFusion administrator screens.  Only internal, trusted users 
should be allowed access.  For further protections, use the security 
capabilities of the webserver or the OS to restrict access to the 
CFIDE/administrator directory when not needed, or copy/remove the 
CFIDE/administrator directory completely off the server when not in use 
(it will be necessary to reload the directory before accessing admin 
functions, of course).
