Rule:

--
Sid:
939

--

Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to use a Frontpage 
client to connect and/or publish content to a Frontpage Server 
Extensions-enabled IIS web server. 

--

Impact:
An attacker can modify your web content, access privileged files or 
modify other users' privileges on the Frontpage-enabled virtual host.

--

Detailed Information:
Microsoft Frontpage is a web-content managing and publishing 
application, which also comes with server extensions for Microsoft IIS 
and Apache web servers. The extensions enable the servers to display 
dynamic content, as well as perform certain levels of web-server 
administration.

--

Affected Systems:
All systems running FPSE on IIS.

--

Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can gain the FPSE username and password via sniffing, social
engineering or brute force guessing. After successfully logging on to 
the system, the attacker can alter web contents, modify login 
information for other users and generally control the web server.

--

Ease of Attack:
After gaining the login credentials the attack is trivial. 

--

False Positives:
If FrontPage authoring is allowed from resources external to the 
protected network this rule will generate an event.

--

False Negatives:
not known.

--

Corrective Action:
Disable FPSE if it is not needed for web-content management.
