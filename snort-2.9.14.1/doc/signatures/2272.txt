--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known
vulnerability in Coreutils LS.

--
Impact:
Denial of Service, possible arbitrary code execution.

--
Detailed Information:
The Coreutils ls command contains an integer overflow vulnerability
which may present an attacker with an exploitation opportunity in
software that uses this command. By supplying a large amount of data to
the ls command in the form of the width variable, an attacker may cause
a DoS to occur. It may also be possible to execute arbitrary code as the
application becomes unstable.

--
Affected Systems:
	Coreutils LS

--
Attack Scenarios:
The attacker needs to supply a large amount of data in the width
variable to the ls command.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. No exploit software required although automated scripts do exist.

--
False Positives:
None known

--
False Negatives:
None known

--
Corrective Action:
Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches

Upgrade the software to the latest non-affected version.
