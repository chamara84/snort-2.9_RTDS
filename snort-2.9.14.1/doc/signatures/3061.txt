Rule:

--
Sid:
3061

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to connect to the distcc
daemon.

--
Impact:
Serious. Execution of arbitrary commands may be possible.

--
Detailed Information:
Distcc is an open source distributed C/C++ compiler that can be used
to compile code on remote hosts that run the distcc daemon.  A vulnerability
exists in the handling of commands that are generated via a distcc client.  The
server does not ensure that compile commands only are sent to it.  A command
sequence can be created that executes commands on a vulnerable server.  No
authentication is required to execute a command on a distcc server.

--
Affected Systems:
	2.18.3 and prior

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can generated a valid distcc command sequence that executes
a command other than a compile on a vulnerable distcc server.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
This is a policy rule and requires proper customization for the
variable $EXTERNAL_NET for sites that allow distcc traffic from
remote hosts.  The $EXTERNAL_NET variable should be replaced with
the IP address(es) of unauthorized client hosts only.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Use the --allow <hosts> option when starting the distcc daemon
to specify authorized client hosts.
