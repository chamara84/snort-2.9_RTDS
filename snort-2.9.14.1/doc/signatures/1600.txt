Rule:  

--
Sid:
1600

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to read a file on a host using a well known vulnerability in htdig.

--
Impact:
Severe. Unauthorized file access

--
Detailed Information:
Some versions of htdig allow inclusions to be made from configuration files as a parameter to the htsearch function. Any file can be included by enclosing it in single quotes ('foo').

Using this vulnerability, any single quoted input string (`....`) is included as an index file by htsearch. This allows an attacker to read any file on the host.

This event is generated when a request is made to the cgi script htsearch with file inclusion attempted. Refer to the rule with sid 1601 for further exploitation attempts.
