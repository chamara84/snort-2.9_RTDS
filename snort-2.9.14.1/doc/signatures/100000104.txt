Summary: 
This event is generated when an empty UDP packet is sent to port 27777, where 
Amp II 3D game servers typically listen.

-- 

Impact: 
After receiving such a packet, the server will fall into an infinite loop, 
potentially consuming all resources on the host system. The administrator will 
need to restart the game server, and possibly the host system.

--
Detailed Information:
