Sid:
702

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known
vulnerability in Microsoft SQL.

--
Impact:
Information gathering and data integrity compromise. Possible unauthorized
administrative access to the server or application.

--
Detailed Information:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to gain unauthorized
access to an implementation of Microsoft SQL server or client.  This can
lead to unauthorized access and possibly escalated privileges to that of 
the administrator. Data stored on the machine can be compromised and 
trust relationships between the victim server and other hosts can be 
exploited by the attacker.

--
Affected Systems:

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can access the authentication mechanism and supply his/her
own credentials to gain access. Alternatively the attacker can exploit
weaknesses to gain access as the administrator.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploits exist.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Disallow administrative access from sources external to the protected
network.

Ensure the system is using an up to date version of the software and has
had all vendor supplied patches applied.
