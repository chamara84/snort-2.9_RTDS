Sid: 326

-- 

Summary: 
This event is generated when a remote command execution exploit against
a finger daemon is attempted.

-- 
Impact: 
Serious. The attacker may be presented with the opportunity to run a
command of his choice on the target UNIX system

--
Detailed Information:
This event is generated when a specific attack against a vulnerable
version of finger daemon is detected. 

The Finger daemon is used to provide information about users on a UNIX
system. It used to be installed and enabled by default on most
UNIX/Linux systems. The attack may allow an attacker to execute a
command remotely on a target system with the privileges of the user
running the "finger" daemon. The user is usually defined in the
/etc/inetd.conf file and is commonly designated as "nobody".

--
Attack Scenarios:  
An attacker may try the attack and then executes a command to download a
backdoor to the target system. He then connects to the system and may
attempt to escalate his privileges by exploiting a local SUID
application to gain "root" privileges.

-- 
Ease of Attack: 
Simple, no exploit software is required, just a specially formatted finger query

-- 
False Positives: 
None Known

--
False Negatives: 
None Known

-- 
Corrective Action: 
Disable the finger daemon or limit the addresses that can access the
service via firewall or TCP wrappers.
