Sid:
1408

--
Summary:
This event is generated when a TCP packet having a large payload was
detected. This is a possible indication of an actual or impending denial
of service attack against a host running the Microsoft Distributed
Transaction Service Coordinator (MSDTC).

--
Impact:
Denial of Service (DoS)

--
Detailed Information:
MSDTC is used in a distributed or clustered environment for distributed
transaction processing on Microsoft operating systems,

A vulnerability exists in the handling of large amounts of data sent to
the MSDTC process listening on port 3372. A packet in excess of 1023
bytes will cause the service to become unresponsive, a packet in excess
of 2000 bytes may cause the entire system to become unresponsive.

--
Affected Systems:
	Microsoft IIS 5.0
	Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 throught 2000
	Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server
	Microsoft Windows 2000 Datacenter Server
	Microsoft Windows 2000 Server
	Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional
 
--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker needs to generate a packet with a payload in excess of 1023
bytes and send it to port 3372 of an affected system.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
Linux FTP servers and clients frequently transfer TCP packets having a 
payload size larger than 1023 bytes. To distinguish a false positive, 
determine whether MSDTC is running on the indicated destination source and 
port.

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:
To manage the vulnerability, configure the system not to autmatically start 
the MSDTC (Source: Security Operations Guide for Windows 2000 Server). 
Alternatively, configure firewall rules to limit access to the service. To 
eliminate false positives, revise the Snort rule to specify IP addresses of 
only those hosts actually running the service.
