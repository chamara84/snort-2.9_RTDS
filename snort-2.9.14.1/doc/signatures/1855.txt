Rule:

--
Sid:
1855

--
Summary:
This event is generated when activity indicating the presence of a
variant of the Stacheldraht DDOS tool is detected.

--
Impact:
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is possible.

--
Detailed Information:
Stracheldraht is a Distributed denial of service tool normally found on
Sun Solaris machines. It is made up of a Client, handler and agent. The
clients connects to the handler. Handlers can connect with up to 1000
agents. Communication between the client and the handler is conducted
using tcp and the communication between the handler and the agent can be
either tcp or icmp_echoreply. This rule detects the a message sent from
the agent to the handler. This message is used to tell the handler that
the machine is still alive and able to take requests. The handler will
then reply with the string "ficken". This traffic differs from the
traffic described on
http://staff.washington.edu/dittrich/misc/stacheldraht.analysis because the
packets have an icmp id of 6666 rather than 666 as noted in the analysis.

--
Affected Systems:
	Sun Solaris
 
--
Attack Scenarios:
The agent can be used to mount a distributed denial of service attack. It
also indicates that a machine is compromised.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
The icmp id along with the keywords may be changed in the
source code which would then evade this rule.

--
Corrective Action:
Disconnect power from the machine and perform forensic analysis on the
hard drives.
