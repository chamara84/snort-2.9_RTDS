--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a
vulnerability in Freespace 2.

--
Impact:
A successful attack may present an attacker with the opportunity to
execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in in Freespace 2 that may allow an attacker to
execute code of their choosing on a vulnerable system.

The problem lies in the handling of data by the client application when
processing server responses. Proper checks are not performed by the
client application and large amounts of data in a server response may
trigger a buffer overflow condition to occur, thus presenting the
attacker with the opportunity to execute code.

--
Affected Systems:
	Freespace 2

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker may supply a large amount of data containing code of their
choosing in a server response to client requests.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.
