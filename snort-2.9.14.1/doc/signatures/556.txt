Rule:  

--

Sid:

556

--

Summary:

A network-internal client has connected to an external GNUTella server
and issued a connect attempt to begin communications.

--

Impact:

Possible policy violation.

--

Detailed Information:

GNUTella is a P2P (Peer-to-Peer) protocol for exchanging arbitrary
files.  Depending on your site's policies, using it may be a policy
violation.

If not properly configured, GNUTella clients may accidentally share out
confidential files.  GNUTella worms (which use deceptive names to
encourage download) and viruses may also be accidentally downloaded by a
client.

This rule being triggered means that a GNUTella client has been detected
on your network.

--

Affected Systems:

Any system with a GNUTella client installed (available for most
platforms)

--

Attack Scenarios:
It is possible for an inside attack to take place by using peer-to-peer
clients to transfer corporate data from an internal resource to an
external third party.

--

Ease of Attack:
Simple. This is peer-to-peer activity.

--

False Positives:

This rule detects the term "GNUTELLA CONNECT" on all ports.  As a
result, any email, web page, or other network content that discusses the
protocol and its messages will trigger this alert.

--

False Negatives:

None known.

--

Corrective Action:

Depends on acceptable use policies.
