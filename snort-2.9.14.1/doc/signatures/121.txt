use the extension ".jpg" or ".bmp" when delivered via e-mail for 
example.

previously known good copy of the registry.

Affected registry keys are:

	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\
	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices

Registry keys added are:

	apxil32 = apxil32.exe

Removal of this entry is required.

Delete the file <drive>:\WINDOWS\Apxil32.exe

Ending the Trojan process is also necessary. A reboot of the infected 
machine is recommended.

A change is also made to the win.ini file, the line run=apxil32.exe 
apxil32.exe is added and should be deleted.
