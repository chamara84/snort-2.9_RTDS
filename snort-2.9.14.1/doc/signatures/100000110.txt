-- 
Summary: 
This event is generated when the Dabber virus attempts to exploit a 
vulnerability in the FTP server installed by the Sasser virus.

-- 

Impact: 
If the Sasser virus is currently running on the affected system, then the 
Dabber virus will be able to install itself as well.

--
Detailed Information:
Some variants of the Sasser virus install an FTP server that listens on port 
5554. However, this FTP server suffers from a buffer overflow in the PORT 
command, which can be exploited with a command of 100 or more characters. The 
Dabber virus makes use of this vulnerability as an infection vetor.

--
Affected Systems:
Any machine with a variant of the Sasser virus whose FTP server listens on port 
5554. 

--

Attack Scenarios: 
A known virus scans the Internet in search of vulnerable systems.

-- 

Ease of Attack: 
Simple, as the virus is in the wild.

-- 

False Positives:
None Known.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

-- 

Corrective Action: 
Users should employ a virus removal tool to clean their system of both Dabber 
and Sasser, and then apply the latest security patches from Microsoft to 
prevent further infections.
