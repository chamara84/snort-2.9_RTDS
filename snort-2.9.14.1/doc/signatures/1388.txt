Summary:
This event is generated when a remote user attempts to send a NOTIFY directive with an overly long Location URL to an internal host's Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) server.

--
Impact:
Attempted administrator access.  A successful attack may cause a denial of service or permit the execution of arbitrary code with administrator privileges.

The buffer overflow attack may permit the execution of arbitrary code on the host with administrator privileges.
