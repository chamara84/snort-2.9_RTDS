<br><b><i><font size=+1>The Basics</font></i></b>
<blockquote>Snort uses a simple, lightweight rules description language
that is flexible and quite powerful.&nbsp; There are a number of simple
guidelines to remember when developing Snort rules.
<p>The first is that Snort rules must be completely contained on a single
line, the Snort rule parser doesn't know how to handle rules on multiple
lines.
<p>Snort rules are divided into two logical sections, the rule header and
the rule options.&nbsp; The rule header contains the rule's action, protocol,
source and destination IP addresses and netmasks, and the source and destination
ports information.&nbsp; The rule option section contains alert messages
and information on which parts of the packet should be inspected to determine
if the rule action should be taken.
<p>Here is an example rule:
<p><a NAME="first_example"></a>
<center><table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="80%" >
<tr>
<td>
<center>alert tcp any any -> 192.168.1.0/24 111 (content:"|00 01 86 a5|";
msg: "mountd access";)</center>
</td>
</tr>
</table></center>

<center>Figure 1 - Sample Snort Rule</center>

<p>The text up to the first parenthesis is the <i>rule header</i> and the
section enclosed in parenthesis is the <i>rule options</i>.&nbsp; The words
before the colons in the rule options section are called <i>option keywords</i>.&nbsp;
Note that the rule options section is not specifically required by any
rule, they are just used for the sake of making tighter definitions of
packets to collect or alert on (or drop, for that matter).&nbsp; All of
the elements in that make up a rule must be true for the indicated rule
action to be taken.&nbsp; When taken together, the elements can be considered
to form a logical AND statement.&nbsp; At the same time, the various rules
in a Snort rules library file can be considered to form a large logical
OR statement.&nbsp; Let's begin by talking about the rule header section.</blockquote>
<a NAME="rule_header"></a>
<br><b><i><font size=+1>Rule Headers</font></i></b>
<blockquote><a NAME="rule_actions"></a><b>Rule Actions</b>:
<p>The rule header contains the information that defines the "who, where,
and what" of a packet, as well as what to do in the event that a packet
with all the attributes indicated in the rule should show up.&nbsp; The
first item in a rule is the <i>rule action</i>.&nbsp; The rule action tells
Snort what to do when it finds a packet that matches the rule criteria.&nbsp;
There are three available actions in Snort, alert, log, and pass.
<ul>
<li>
alert - generate an alert using the selected alert method, and then log
the packet</li>

<li>
log - log the packet</li>

<li>
pass - drop (ignore) the packet</li>
</ul>
<a NAME="protocols"></a><b>Protocols</b>:
<p>The next field in a rule is the protocol.&nbsp; There are three IP protocols
that Snort currently analyzes for suspicious behavior, tcp, udp, and icmp.&nbsp;
In the future there may be more, such as ARP, IGRP, GRE, OSPF, RIP, IPX,
etc.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
tcp</li>

<li>
udp</li>

<li>
icmp</li>
</ul>
<a NAME="ip_addresses"></a><b>IP Addresses</b>:
<p>The next portion of the rule header deals with the IP address and port
information for a given rule.&nbsp; The keyword "any" may be used to define
any address.&nbsp; Snort does not have a mechanism to provide host name
lookup for the IP address fields in the rules file.&nbsp; The addresses
are formed by a straight numeric IP address and a <a href="http://public.pacbell.net/dedicated/cidr.html">CIDR</a>
block.&nbsp; The CIDR block indicates the netmask that should be applied
to the rule's address and any incoming packets that are tested against
the rule.&nbsp; A CIDR block mask of /24 indicates a Class C network, /16
a Class B network, and /32 indicates a specific machine address.&nbsp;
For example, the address/CIDR combination 192.168.1.0/24 would signify
the block of addresses from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.255.&nbsp; Any rule
that used this designation for, say, the destination address would match
on any address in that range.&nbsp; The CIDR designations give us a nice
short-hand way to designate large address spaces with just a few characters.
<p>In <a href="#first_example">Figure 1</a>, the source IP address was
set to match for any computer talking, and the destination address was
set to match on the 192.168.1.0 Class C network.
<p>There is an operator that can be applied to IP addresses, the <i>negation
operator</i>.&nbsp; This operator tells Snort to match any IP address <b><i>except
</i></b>the
one indicated by the listed IP address.&nbsp; The negation operator is
indicated with a "!".&nbsp; For example, an easy modification to the initial
example is to make it alert on any traffic that originates outside of the
local net with the negation operator as shown in Figure 2.
<p><a NAME="Figure 2"></a>
<center><table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="80%" >
<tr>
<td>
<center>alert tcp !192.168.1.0/24 any -> 192.168.1.0/24 111 (content: "|00
01 86 a5|"; msg: "external mountd access";)</center>
</td>
</tr>
</table></center>

<center>Figure 2 - Example IP Address Negation Rule</center>

<p>This rule's IP addresses indicate "any tcp packet with a source IP address
<b><i>not</i></b>
originating from the internal network and a destination address on the&nbsp;
internal network".
<p><a NAME="port_numbers"></a><b>Port Numbers</b>
<p>Port numbers may be specified in a number of ways, including "any" ports,
static port definitions, ranges, and by negation.&nbsp; "Any" ports are
a wildcard value, meaning literally any port.&nbsp; Static ports are indicated
by a single port number, such as 111 for portmapper, 23 for telnet, or
80 for http, etc.&nbsp; Port ranges are indicated with the range operator
":".&nbsp; The range operator may be applied in a number of ways to take
on different meanings, such as in Figure 3.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<center><table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="80%" >
<tr>
<td>
<center>log udp any any -> 192.168.1.0/24 1:1024&nbsp;
<br><i>log udp traffic coming from any port and destination ports ranging
from 1 to 1024</i></center>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<center>log tcp any any -> 192.168.1.0/24 :6000&nbsp;
<br><i>log tcp traffic from any port going to ports less than or equal
to 6000</i></center>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<center>log tcp any :1024 -> 192.168.1.0/24 500:&nbsp;
<br><i>log tcp traffic from priveleged ports less than or equal to 1024
going to ports greater than or equal to 500</i></center>
</td>
</tr>
</table></center>

<center>Figure 3 - Port Range Examples</center>

<p><br>
<p>Port negation is indicated by using the negation operator "!".&nbsp;
The negation operator may be applied against any of the other rule types
(except any, which would translate to none, how Zen...).&nbsp; For example,
if for some twisted reason you wanted to log everything except the X Windows
ports, you could do something like the rule in Figure 4.
<br>&nbsp;

</tr>
</table></center>

<center>Figure 4 - Example of Port Negation</center>

<p><br>
<p><a NAME="direction_operator"></a><b>The Direction Operator</b>
<p>The <i>direction operator</i> "->" indicates the orientation, or "direction",
of the traffic that the rule applies to.&nbsp; The IP address and port
numbers on the left side of the direction operator is considered to be
the traffic coming from the source host, and the address and port information
on the right side of the operator is the destination host.&nbsp; There
is also a <i>bidirectional operator</i>, which is indicated with a "&lt;>"
symbol.&nbsp; This tells Snort to consider the address/port pairs in either
the source or destination orientation.&nbsp; This is handy for recording/analyzing
both sides of a conversation, such as telnet or POP3 sessions.&nbsp; An
example of the bidirectional operator being used to record both sides of
a telnet session is shown in Figure 5.
<br>&nbsp;

</td>

</blockquote>
<a NAME="rule_options"></a><b><i><font size=+1>Rule Options</font></i></b>
<blockquote>Rule options form the heart of Snort's intrusion detection
engine, combining ease of use with power and flexibility.&nbsp; All Snort
rule options are separated from each other using the semicolon ";" character.&nbsp;
Rule option keywords are separated from their arguments with a colon ":"
character. As of this writing, there are fifteen rule option keywords&nbsp;
available for Snort:
<ul>
<li>
msg - prints a message in alerts and packet logs</li>

<li>
logto - log the packet to a user specified filename instead of the standard
output file</li>

<li>
minfrag - set a threshold value for the smallest acceptable IP fragment
size</li>

<li>
ttl - test the IP header's TTL field value</li>

<li>
id - test the IP header's fragment ID field for a specific value</li>

<li>
dsize - test the packet's payload size against a value</li>

<li>
content - search for a pattern in the&nbsp; packet's payload</li>

<li>
offset - modifier for the content option, sets the offset to begin attempting
a pattern match</li>

<li>
depth - modifier for the content option, sets the maximum search depth
for a pattern match attempt</li>

<li>
flags - test the TCP flags for certain values</li>

<li>
seq - test the TCP sequence number field for a specific value</li>

<li>
ack - test the TCP acknowledgement field for a specific value</li>

<li>
itype - test the ICMP type field against a specific value</li>

<li>
icode - test the ICMP code field against a specific value</li>

<li>
session - dumps the application layer information for a given session</li>
</ul>

<p><br><a NAME="msg"></a><b>Msg</b>
<p>The <i>msg</i> rule option tells the logging and alerting engine the
message to print along with a packet dump or to an alert.&nbsp; It is a
simple text string that utilizes the "\" as an escape character to indicate
a discrete character that might otherwise confuse Snort's rules parser
(such as the semi-colon ";" character).
<p>Format:
<blockquote>msg: "<i>&lt;message text></i>";</blockquote>

<p><br><a NAME="logto"></a><b>Logto</b>
<p>The <i>logto</i> option tells Snort to log all packets that trigger
this rule to a special output log file.&nbsp; This is especially handy
for combining data from things like NMAP activity, HTTP CGI scans, etc.&nbsp;
It should be noted that this option does not work when Snort is in binary
logging mode.
<p>Format:
<blockquote>logto: "<i>&lt;filename></i>";</blockquote>

<p><br><a NAME="minfrag"></a><b>Minfrag</b>
<p>Minfrag sets a minimum size threshold for a fragmented packet.&nbsp;
It is generally used in conjunction with a single alert rule to set a boundry
for the minimum fragment size that is acceptable on a network segment.&nbsp;
It makes a handy detector for attackers that like to break their fragments
into tiny pieces before transmitting them to try to avoid detection mechaisms.&nbsp;
Generally speaking, there is virtually no commercial network equipment
available that generates fragments smaller than 256-bytes, so people can
take advantage of this fact by setting their minfrag value somewhere below
that threshold.&nbsp; See Figure 6 for an example of a rule that uses the
minfrag option.
<p>Format:
<blockquote>minfrag: "<i>&lt;number></i>";</blockquote>

<center><table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="80%" >
<tr>
<td>
<center>alert tcp any any -> any any (minfrag: 256; msg: "Tiny fragments
detected, possible hostile activity";)</center>
</td>
</tr>
</table></center>

<center>Figure 6 - Minfrag Rule Option Example</center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><a NAME="ttl"></a><b>TTL</b>
<p>This rule option is used to set a specific time-to-live value to test
against.&nbsp; The test it performs is only sucessful on an exact match.&nbsp;
This option keyword was intended for use in the detection of traceroute
attempts.
<p>Format:
<blockquote>ttl: "<i>&lt;number></i>";</blockquote>
<a NAME="id"></a><b>ID</b>
<p>This option keyword is used to test for an exact match in the IP header
fragment ID field.&nbsp; Some hacking tools (and other programs) set this
field specifically for various purposes, for example the value 31337 is
very popular with some hackers.&nbsp; This can be turned against them by
putting a simple rule in place to test for this and some other "hacker
numbers".
<p>Format:
<blockquote>id: "<i>&lt;number></i>;</blockquote>

<p><br><a NAME="dsize"></a><b>Dsize</b>
<p>The dsize option is used to test the packet payload size.&nbsp; It may
be set to any value, plus use the greater than/less than signs to indicate
ranges and limits.&nbsp; For example, if you know that a certain service
has a buffer of a certain size, you can set this option to watch for attempted
buffer overflows.&nbsp; It has the added advantage of being a much faster
way to test for a buffer overflow than a payload content check.
<p>Format:
<blockquote>dsize: [<i>></i>|<i>&lt;</i>] <i>&lt;number></i>;
<br>Note: The > and &lt; operators are optional!</blockquote>

<p><br><a NAME="content"></a><b>Content</b>
<p>The content keyword is one of the more important features of Snort.&nbsp;
It allows the user to set rules that search for specific content in the
packet payload and trigger response based on that data.&nbsp; Whenever
a content option pattern match is performed, the Boyer-Moore pattern match
function is called and the (rather computationally expensive) test is performed
against the packet contents.&nbsp; If data exactly matching the argument
data string os contained anywhere within the packet's payload, the test
is successful and the remainder of the rule option tests are performed.&nbsp;
Be aware that this test <b>is</b> case sensitive.
<p>The option data for the content keyword is somewhat complex; it can
contain mixed text and binary data.&nbsp; The binary data is generally
enclosed within the pipe ("|") character and represented as <i>bytecode</i>.&nbsp;
Bytecode represents binary data as hexidecimal numbers and is a good shorthand
method for describing complex binary data.&nbsp; Figure 7 contains an example
of mixed text and binary data in a Snort rule.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<center><table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="80%" >
<tr>
<td>
<center>alert tcp any any -> 192.168.1.0/24 143 (content: "|90C8 C0FF FFFF|/bin/sh";
msg: "IMAP buffer overflow!";)</center>
</td>
</tr>
</table></center>

<center>Figure 7 - Mixed Binary Bytecode and Text in a Content Rule Option</center>

<p>Format:
<blockquote>content: "<i>&lt;content string></i>";</blockquote>

<p><br><a NAME="offset"></a><b>Offset</b>
<p>The offset rule option is used as a modifier to rules using the content
option keyword.&nbsp; This keyword modifies the starting search position
for the pattern match function from the beginning of the packet payload.&nbsp;
It is very useful for things like CGI scan detection rules where the content
search string is never found in the first four bytes of the payload.&nbsp;
Care should be taken against setting the offset value too "tightly" and
potentially missing an attack!&nbsp; This rule option keyword cannot be
used without also specifying a content rule option.
<p>Format:
<blockquote>offset: <i>&lt;number></i>;</blockquote>

<p><br><a NAME="depth"></a><b>Depth</b>
<p>Depth is another content rule option modifier.&nbsp; This sets the maximum
search depth for the content pattern match function to search from the
beginning of its search region.&nbsp; It is useful for limiting the pattern
match function from performing inefficient searches once the possible search
region for a given set of content has been exceeded.&nbsp; (Which is to
say, if you're searching for "cgi-bin/phf" in a web-bound packet, you probably
don't need to waste time searching the payload beyond the first 20 bytes!)&nbsp;
See Figure 8 for an example of a combined content, offset, and depth search
rule.
<p>Format:
<blockquote>depth: <i>&lt;number></i>;</blockquote>

<br>&nbsp;
<center><table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="80%" >

<td>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><a NAME="flags"></a><b>Flags</b>
<p>This rule tests the TCP flags for an exact match.&nbsp; There are actually
<b>8
</b>flags
variables available in Snort:
<ul>
<li>
F - FIN (LSB in TCP Flags byte)</li>

<li>
S - SYN</li>

<li>
R - RST</li>

<li>
P - PSH</li>

<li>
A - ACK</li>

<li>
U - URG</li>

<li>
2 - Reserved bit 2</li>

<li>
1 - Reserved bit 1 (MSB in TCP Flags byte)</li>
</ul>
The reserved bits can be used to detect unusual behavior, such as IP stack
fingerprinting attempts or other suspicious activity.&nbsp; All of the
flags are considered as a whole for this test, they must all be "up" for
this rule option to be successful.&nbsp; For instance, Figure 9 shows a
SYN-FIN scan detection rule.
<p>Format:
<blockquote>flags: <i>&lt;flag values></i>;</blockquote>

<br>&nbsp;
<center><table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="80%" >
<tr>
<td>
<center>alert any any -> 192.168.1.0/24 any (flags: SF; msg: "Possible
SYN FIN scan";)</center>
</td>
</tr>
</table></center>

<center>Figure 9 - Sample TCP Flags Specification</center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p><a NAME="seq"></a><b>Seq</b>
<p>This rule option refers to the TCP sequence number.&nbsp; Essentially,
it detects if the packet has a static sequence number set, and is therefore
pretty much unused.&nbsp; It was included for the sake of completeness.
<p>Format:
<blockquote>seq: <i>&lt;number></i>;</blockquote>

<p><br><a NAME="ack"></a><b>Ack</b>
<p>The ack rule option keyword refers to the TCP header's acknowledge field.&nbsp;
This rule has one practical purpose so far: detecting&nbsp; <a href="http://www.insecure.org">NMAP</a>
TCP pings.&nbsp; A NMAP TCP ping sets this field to zero and sends a packet
with the TCP ACK flag set to determine if a network host is active.&nbsp;
The rule to detect this activity is shown in Figure 10.
<p>Format:
<blockquote>ack: <i>&lt;number></i>;</blockquote>

<br>&nbsp;
<center><table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="80%" >
<tr>
<td>
<center>alert any any -> 192.168.1.0/24 any (flags: A; ack: 0; msg: "NMAP
TCP ping";)</center>
</td>
</tr>
</table></center>

<center>Figure 10 - TCP ACK Field Usage</center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p><a NAME="itype"></a><b>Itype</b>
<p>This rule tests the value of the ICMP type field.&nbsp; It is set using
the <i>numeric</i> value of this field.&nbsp; For a list of the available
values, look in the decode.h file included with Snort or in any ICMP reference.&nbsp;
It should be noted that the values can be set out of range to detect invalid
ICMP type values that are sometimes used in denial of service and flooding
attacks.
<p>Format:
<blockquote>itype: <i>&lt;number></i>;</blockquote>

<p><br><a NAME="icode"></a><b>Icode</b>
<p>The icode rule option keyword is pretty much identical to the itype
rule, just set a numeric value in here and Snort will detect any traffic
using that ICMP code value.&nbsp; Out of range values can also be set to
detect suspicious traffic.
<p>Format:
<blockquote>icode: <i>&lt;number></i>;</blockquote>

<p><br><a NAME="session"></a><b>Session</b>
<p>The session keyword is brand new as of version 1.3.1.1 and is used to
extract the user data from TCP sessions.&nbsp; It is extremely useful for
seeing what users are typing in telnet, rlogin, ftp, or even web sessions.&nbsp;
There are two available argument keywords for the session rule option,
<i>printable</i>
or <i>all</i>.&nbsp; The <i>printable</i> keyword only prints out data
that the user would normally see or be able to type.&nbsp; The <i>all</i>
keyword substitutes non-printable characters with their hexadecimal equivalents.&nbsp;
This function can slow Snort down considerably, so it shouldn't be used
in heavy load situations, and is probably best suited for post-processing
binary (tcpdump format) log files.&nbsp; See Figure 11 for a good example
of a telnet session logging rule.
<p>Format:
<blockquote>session: <i>[printable|all]</i>;</blockquote>

<br>&nbsp;

<tr>
<td>

<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><a NAME="includes"></a><b>Includes</b><b></b>
<p>Versions of Snort after 1.3.1.2 include new rules file parsing functionality
developed by Christian Lademann, including two new rules file keywords.&nbsp;
The first of these keywords is <i>include</i>.&nbsp; The <i>include</i>
keyword allows other rule files to be included with the rules file that
indicated on the Snort command line.
<p>Format:
<blockquote>include: <i>&lt;include file path/name></i></blockquote>
Note that there is no semicolon at the end of this line.&nbsp; Included
files will substitute any predefined variable values into their own variable
references.&nbsp; See the Variables section for more information on defining
and using variables in Snort rule files.
<p><a NAME="variables"></a><b>Variables</b>
<p>As of version 1.3.1.2, variables may be defined in Snort.&nbsp; These
are simple substitution variables set with the <i>var</i> keyword as in
Figure 12.

</table></center>

<center>Figure 12 - Example of Variable Definition and Usage</center>

<p>The rule variable names can be modified in several ways.&nbsp; You can
define <i>meta-variables </i>using the "$" operator.&nbsp; These can be
used with the variable modifier operators, "?" and "-".
<ul>
<li>
$var - define meta variable</li>

<li>
$(var) - replace with the contents of variable "var"</li>

<li>
$(var:-default) - replace with the contents of the variable "var" or with
"default" if "var" is undefined.</li>

<li>
$(var:?message) - replace with the contents of variable "var" or print
out the error message "message" and exit</li>
</ul>

<p>alert tcp any any -> 192.168.1.0/24 21 (content: "user root"; msg: "FTP
root login";)
<br>alert tcp any any -> 192.168.1.0/24 21 (content: "USER root"; msg:
"FTP root login";)</center>

<p>The second of those two rules will catch most every automated root login
attempt, but none that use lower case characters for "user".&nbsp; Case
insensitivity is a feature that will probably be added in future versions
of Snort, but for now be aware that case counts!
<p><a NAME="speed_content"></a><b>Speeding Up Rules That Have Content Options</b><b></b>
<p>The order that rules are tested by the detection engine is completely
independent of the order that they are written in a rule.&nbsp; The last
rule test that is done (when necessary) is always the content rule option.&nbsp;
Take advantage of this fact by using other faster rule options that can
detect whether or not the content needs to be checked at all.&nbsp; For
instance, most of the time when data is sent from client to server after
a TCP session is established, the PSH and ACK TCP flags are set on the
packet containing the data.&nbsp; This fact can be taken advantage of by
rules that need to test payload content coming from the client to the sever
with a simple TCP flag test that is far less computationally expensive
than the pattern match algorithm.&nbsp; Knowing this, a simple way to speed
up rules that use content options is to also perform a flag test, as in
Figure 14.&nbsp; The basic idea is that if the PSH and ACK flags aren't
set, there's no need to test the packet payload for the given rule.&nbsp;
If the flags are set, the additional computing power required to perform
the test is negligible.
