# summary of how this script can be called:
#        * <postinst> `configure' <most-recently-configured-version>
#        * <old-postinst> `abort-upgrade' <new version>
#        * <conflictor's-postinst> `abort-remove' `in-favour' <package>
#          <new-version>
#        * <deconfigured's-postinst> `abort-deconfigure' `in-favour'
#          <failed-install-package> <version> `removing'
#          <conflicting-package> <version>
# for details, see /usr/doc/packaging-manual/
#
# quoting from the policy:
#     Any necessary prompting should almost always be confined to the
#     post-installation script, and should be protected with a conditional
#     so that unnecessary prompting doesn't happen if a package's
#     installation fails and the `postinst' is called with `abort-upgrade',
#     `abort-remove' or `abort-deconfigure'.

		#    It greps for our current pppd PID in all pppd and ipppd
		#    pidfiles.
		#    It *should* return exactly one file name: the one with
		#    our current pppd PID in it; however, to be safe, we fence
		#    it with a head -1.
		# 2. basename $(egrep ...) .pid:
		#    It takes the file name from the egrep and strips off its
		#    path and the .pid suffix
		# 3. sed:
		#    Unfortunately the filenames of pppd and ipppd differ:
		#    pppd uses $INTERFACE.pid, while ipppd uses
		#    ipppd.$INTERFACE.pid.
		#    The .pid is already stripped off by basename, thus, we
		#    just strip off any "ipppd." prefix and end up in the
		#    plain interface name.
		#    Maybe pppd decides to change it's pidfile naming
		#    convention according to ipppd somewhere in the future,
		#    thus, we use '^i\?pppd\.' (sed eregex) and thus strip
		#    off all "ipppd." and all "pppd." prefixes. This doesn't
		#    harm anyways.
		#    Because of the pppd pidfile naming convention, our
		#    approach works always with ipppd and mostly with pppd:
		#    the latter only, if the user did not decide to rename
		#    his ppp interface to something else than ppp*
		#    (not possible currently, afaics).
