snort (2.9.2.2-3) experimental; urgency=medium

  The database output plugins have been removed by the upstream maintainers in
  Snort 2.9.3. These output plugins were already deprecated as of Snort 2.9.2.
  These have been removed alongside the Aruba and Prelude outputs.
  
  After the upgrade to a Snort 2.9.3.x release, systems using the database
  output should move to full unified2 logging and use barnyard2 to read those
  unified2 files and input them into their database.

snort (2.8.5.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  The database information used by Snort to log alerts into a database 
  (and configured automatically through Debconf) has now been moved to the
  /etc/snort/database.conf file.

  Note that this file might be empty if you are not logging to a database

snort (2.7.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Sourcefire changed the license of the IDS ruleset in 2.4 introducing the "VRT
  Certified rules" ruleset which is the official ruleset for Snort. This
  ruleset, however, is provided only through a non-free license which prohibits
  redistribution within this package.

  As a consequence this package provides only free (GPL) rules. No rule 
  with a sid in the 3,465-1,000,000 range (VRT Certified) is included here.
  The rules provided on this package are based on the official ruleset for
  Snort 2.4 (updated 7/27/05) and the Community ruleset.

  Certified rules download require users either to pay (if they want the latest
  rules) or register (for rules provided with a 30-delay period). Users
  wishing to go this way can use the 'oinkmaster' package to auomatically
  update their rulesets once they have registered at snort.org's site.

snort (2.3.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * In Snort version 2.3.0 and later the preferred configuration method
    uses /etc/default/snort rather than /etc/snort/snort.common.parameters.
    The new approach makes it possible to introduce improvements in the
    init.d script, such as sanity checks for common misconfigurations.

  * Upgrading automatically generates the file /etc/default/snort
    from /etc/snort/snort.common.parameters. 

  * Since the automatically generated file may not be correct, you should 
    inspect it or create a new one to your liking.  If the configuration
    file is correct, delete /etc/snort/snort.common.parameters and restart
    the server to use the new file. The system will run Snort with the old
    configuration file until you do so.
