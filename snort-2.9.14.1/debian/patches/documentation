+2005-04-22 - Snort 2.3.3 Released
+
+* Fixed sfPortscan Open Ports not getting suppressed.
+
+* Added new mini-preprocessor to catch the X-Link2State vulnerability.
+  See Snort manual for details.
+
+2005-03-10 - Snort 2.3.2 Released
+
+* Removed end-of-line parser fix in favor of completely reworking
+  this at the next parser overhaul.
+
+2005-03-09 - Snort 2.3.1 Released
+
+* Fixed issue where the number of flowbits were too small. Thanks Marc
+  Norton for the fix.
+
+* Fixed parsing of comments at end of line in config file.  In
+  snort.conf, anything that follows a # on a line is considered a
+  comment. Thanks Steve Sturges for the fix.
+
+* Fixed alignment issue causing sfPortscan to crash on Solaris/HPUX.
+  Thanks Andy Mullican for the fix. Thanks Senthil Prabu.S and
+  Jonathan Miner for working with us on this.
+
+2005-01-25 - Snort 2.3.0 Final Released
+
+* Fixed issue with sfPortscan reporting incorrect IP datagram length.
+  Thanks Jon Hart for the test case and finding the bug, and Marc Norton
+  for resolving the issue.
+
+* Threshold/Suppression now prints properly when logging to syslog.
+  Thanks Sekure for pointing out the problem. Thanks Steve Sturges for
+  working on the fix.
+
+* Threshold memcap argument now correctly handles non-integer input.
+  Thanks nnposter for the patch.
+
+* Fixed issue reported by Allan Jensen, where on MacOS X, ppp links were
+  not decoded properly. Thanks Dan Roelker for the fix.
+
+* Snort manual and FAQ are updated for 2.3. Thanks Jen Harvey for your
+  work on putting it all together. 
+
+2004-12-15 - Snort 2.3.0 RC2 Released
+
+* Small performance improvement to arpspoof and also fixed a problem
+  where the list of configured IP/MAC entries would contain only one
+  entry and leaked memory (Jeff Nathan).
+
+* Fixed a problem affecting MacOS X where linking may fail with
+  non-standard libraries when global symbols are encountered multiple
+  times (Jeff Nathan).
+
+* Ignore RST|ACK midstream pickup case so we don't get an evasive TCP
+  alerts.  Thanks for the report, Sekure. Thanks Dan Roelker for the fix.
+
+* Moved CheckLogDir() to after parsing snort.conf (for IDS mode) so the 
+  logdir config will work if the default or command-line logdir does not
+  exist on the system. Thanks Dan Roelker.
+
+* Fixed bug when setting the doe_ptr on a successful pcre match.
+  It is now set relative to base_ptr. Thanks Steve Sturges for the
+  fix.
+
+* Added from_beginning and multiplier options for byte_jump.
+  from_beginning skips bytes from the beginning of the content,
+  instead of from the location immediately following the number
+  of bytes to skip.  multiplier takes a numeric argument, and
+  skips x times that number of bytes. Thanks again to Steve Sturges.
+
+* In "fast" output, now log only actual packet contents when UDP
+  data length is greater than actual data length. Thanks Brian
+  Caswell for spotting this, and Andrew Mullican for working on the fix.
+
+* Please check the ChangeLog for further details.  
+
+2004-11-18 - Snort 2.3.0 RC1 Released
+
+* Added IPS functionality from Snort-Inline.  A big thanks to the
+  Snort-Inline guys (Jed Haile, Rob McMillen, William Metcalf, and Victor
+  Julien).  Also, Thanks Dan Roelker for doing the integrating of
+  Snort-Inline into the official Snort project.  
+
+* Added new portscan detector.  The design and implementation was headed
+  up by Dan Roelker, and included Marc Norton and Jeremy Hewlett.  
+
+* Numerous changes for better 64bit Snort support from Jeremy Hewlett and
+  Marc Norton.  Additionally, an --enable-64bit-gcc option was added to
+  configure.  However, there are still some memory alignment issues to
+  work out before 64bit mode is fully functional, patches are welcomed.
+  Thanks Chris Baker for doing 64bit testing.  
+
+* Added not_established keyword to the flow detection option.  This allows
+  snort to do dynamic firewall rulesets.  Experimental for now.  
+
+* Added an enforce_state keyword to stream4 so we won't pick up midstream
+  sessions.  This works well for asynchronous links and also for
+  just monitoring legitimate traffic.  
+
+* Relocated ./contrib files to http://www.snort.org/dl/contrib as many
+  are not maintained by Sourcefire and are out of date. The rpm and
+  schema files have been relocated in their respective 'rpm' and 'schemas'
+  directories under the snort parent directory.
+
+* perfmonitor config line can now be configured with "accumulate" or
+  "reset."  Thanks Marc Norton for the feature, and Barry Basselgia for
+  pointing out the issue.  Thanks Scott Dexter and Andreas Ostling for
+  doing some initial testing.  
+
+* Fixed 64-bit bug in sfmemcap.c found and tested by Ryan Matteson
+  and Clay McClure.  Thanks guys.  
+
+* Fixed reference times to match log time for first packet, for an event
+  generated by a reassembled packet.  Incremented event ID to give
+  unique ID for each packet.  Also made unified logging compatible with
+  Windows.  Thanks Andrew Mullican for the fix.  
+
+* Fixed linux perfmonitoring stats for the 2.6 kernel.  Thanks to
+  everyone that reported this bug.  Thanks Dan Roelker for the fix.  
+
+* Get thresholding/suppression to work for alerts that do not
+  contain an ip header (primarily decode alerts).  Thanks
+  Brian Caswell.  
+
+* Fix conditions where snort would log double web alerts that
+  contained only content options (no uricontents).  Thanks to kawa for
+  finding and reporting this bug.  
+
+* Fix suppression/thresholding bug for non-rule alerts.  Thanks to
+  Alex Butcher for reporting it to us.  
+
+* Many other bug fixes, please check the ChangeLog for details.

+2007-05-09 - Snort 2.6.1.5 Released
+[*] New Additions
+    * Updated HttpInspect to normalize parameters that are part of the
+      client request body in the same way it normalizes HTTP URIs.
+      Added a modifier keyword to be used in conjunction with a content
+      option in the rules to search only the normalized HTTP client request
+      body.  Also added stats for HttpInspect to track number of various
+      types of normalizations and HTTP methods.
+
+[*] Improvements
+    * Fix header files to avoid conflicts with system files on BSD for
+      IPv6 data structures.
+
+    * Fix possible memory leak in Stream4 when HttpInspect is being
+      used.
+
+2007-03-26 - Snort 2.6.1.4 Released
+[*] New Additions
+    * Added detection for BSD IPv6 fragmentation overflow (CVE-2007-1365).
+      New options configure the behavior of the detection and new decoder
+      alerts for truncated IPv6 headers and a Fragmentation alert for the 
+      specific overflow attack.
+
+[*] Security Improvements
+    * Updated code to use safer functions that perform bounds checking
+      when doing string or memory copies and snprintf buffer writes.
+      Ensure null termination on string buffers and perform initialization
+      on memory allocations.
+
+2007-02-18 - Snort 2.6.1.3 Released
+[*] Improvements
+    * Updated DCE/RPC dynamic protocol normalizer to perform additional
+      boundary checking when reassembling SMB fragments.  This addresses
+      a potential remotely exploitable stack-based buffer overflow.
+
+    * Updated Frag3 to protect against potential for fragments without
+      ethernet header being passed from iptables to Snort inline.
+
+2006-12-07 - Snort 2.6.1.2 Released
+[*] Improvements
+    * Fixed problem with snort using high CPU and potentially reprocessing
+      the same TCP reassembled packets with a sequence number wrap and
+      packets missing from the queue (out of order, dropped, or async
+      network).
+
+    * Updated DCE/RPC dynamic protocol normalizer to protect against
+      integer underflow conditions.
+
+    * Updated unified output plugin to work correctly on certain 64bit
+      platforms where timeval structure is a different size.  A patch
+      to barnyard that is associated with this fix can be found at:
+      http://secure.lv/~nikns/stuff/barnyard_64bit.diff.
+
+2006-11-22 - Snort 2.6.1.1 Released
+[*] Improvements
+    * Fixed problem with snort using high CPU and potentially reprocessing
+      the same TCP reassembled packets at session end or TCP ACK of only
+      part of a packet.
+
+2006-11-16 - Snort 2.6.1 Released
+[*] New Additions
+    * Support for UDP "session" tracking to Stream4.  Enable via
+      --enable-stream4udp option to configure script.  This allows
+      the use of flow option with UDP rules.  Includes tracking
+      of stats for UDP sessions.  A session is created for rules that
+      use the flow or flowbits keywords.  Also provided the ability to
+      ignore UDP any any -> any any rules as a performance improvement.
+
+    * Stream5 (for Beta testing) as replacement for Stream4
+      and Flow preprocessors.  See README.stream for details.
+
+    * Allow blocking of entire session in inline mode via stream API.
+      All subsequent packets on that session are blocked.
+
+    * Dynamic DCE/RPC protocol normalizer and defragmentation
+      module.  See README.dcerpc for details.
+
+    * SSH (for Beta testing) protocol analyzer.  See README.ssh for
+      details.
+
+    * Support for GRE encapsulated protocol (experimental).  Enable via
+      --enable-gre option to configure script.
+    
+    * Aruba networks output plugin (experimental).  See README.ARUBA for
+      details.  Enable via --enable-aruba option to configure script.
+
+    * Smaller memory footprint pattern mattcher using Aho-Corasick,
+      using NFA.  Use 'config detection: search-method ac-bnfa' to 
+      enable.  This will become the default pattern matcher in future
+      releases.  Wu-Manhber has been deprecated (mwm).
+
+[*] Improvements
+
+    * Added parameter to dynamicengine to allow specification of
+      directory instead of implicit file.  This will load all engine shared
+      libraries within the specified directory.  Can also use
+      --dynamic-engine-lib-dir command-line option.  Fix handling of
+      loading multiple instances of the same dynamic library (engine,
+      detection, or preprocessor).
+
+    * Updates to HTTP inspect to handle different versions of IIS with
+      the related iis profiles.  See README.httpinspect for details.
+
+    * Cleaned up inline initialization to better handle test mode.
+
+    * Updates to interface dependent variable definitions.
+
+    * Added stats for packets not yet processed -- those that are still in
+      the buffer used by pcap.
+
+    * Fixed issue with fewer alerts being generated when snort is compiled
+      with gcc 4.x by using no-strict-aliasing flag.
+
+    * Require each rule to have a unique sid/gid pair.

+2007-07-09 - Snort 2.7.0
+
+[*] New Additions
+    * Stream5 is now the default stream processor and replaces both flow
+      and Stream4.  Refer to the Snort manual and README.stream5 for
+      details on how to configure it for OS target-specific TCP
+      processing.
+
+[*] Improvements
+    * Fixed header files to avoid conflicts with system files on BSD for
+      IPv6 data structures.
+
+    * Reduced memory footprint for smtp preprocessor.
+
+    * Ensured Snort frees memory from preprocessors before exit.  Only
+      outstanding memory in use is related to pattern matcher and
+      rules.
+
+[*] Security Improvements
+    * Further updates that use safer functions that perform bounds checking
+      when doing string or memory copies and snprintf buffer writes.
+      Ensure null termination on string buffers and perform initialization

+2005-10-17 - Snort 2.4.3 Released
+[*] Improvements
+    * Fixed possible buffer overflow in  back orifice preprocessor.
+    * Added snort.conf options to bo preprocessor for finer control of 
+      alerting and dropping of bo traffic.
+    * Added alert to detect the bo buffer overflow attack against snort.
+
+2005-09-28 - Snort 2.4.2 Released
+[*] Improvements
+    * Fixed crash bug with -T and default logging setup first reported by 
+      Zultan.
+    * Corrected Win32 directory setup for new WinPCAP.
+
+2005-09-16 - Snort 2.4.1 Released
+[*] New additions
+    * Added a -K command line option to manually select the logging mode using
+      a single switch.  The -b and -N switches will be deprecated in version 
+      2.7.  Pcap logging is now the default for Snort at startup, use "-K ascii"
+      to revert to old behavior.
+
+[*] Improvements
+    * Win32 version now supports winpcap 3.1 and MySQL client 4.13.
+    * Added event on zero-length RPC fragments.
+    * Fixed TCP SACK processing for text based outputs that could result in a 
+      DoS.
+    * General improvements to frag3 including Teardrop detection fix.
+    * Fixed a bug in the PPPoE decoder.
+    * Added patch for time stats from Bill Parker.  Enable with configure

+    * Fixed IDS mode bailing at startup if logdir is specified in snort.conf
+      and /var/log/snort doesn't exist.
+    * Added decoder for IPEnc for OpenBSD.  Thanks Jason Ish for the patch 
+      (long time ago) and Chris Kuethe for reraising the issue.
+    * Allow snort to use usernames (-u) and groupnames (-g) that include 
+      numbers.  Thanks to Shaick for the patch.
+    * Fixed broken -T option.
+    * Change ip_proto to ip for portscan configuration.  Thanks David Bianco
+      for pointing this out.
+    * Fix for prelude initialization.  Thanks Yoann Vandoorselaere for the
+      update.
+    * For content matches, when subsequent rule options fail, start searching
+      again in correct location.
+    * Updated Win32 to handle pflog patch.
+    * Added support for new OpenBSD pflog format.  Older pflog format,
+      OpenBSD 3.3 and earlier is still supported.  Thanks Breno Leitao
+      and Christian Reis for the patch.
+    * Added statistics counter for ETH_LOOPBACK packets.  Thanks rmkml
+      for the patch.
+
+2005-07-22 - Snort 2.4.0 Released
+
+[*] Distribution Change
+    * Rules are no longer distributed as part of the Snort releases, they are
+      available as a separate download from snort.org.  This was done for 
+      three reasons: 
+        1) To better manage the new rules licensing.
+        2) To reduce the size of the engine download.
+        3) To move the thousands of documentation files for the rules into
+           the rules tarballs.  If you've ever checked Snort out of CVS you'll
+           know why this is a Good Thing.
+
+[*] New additions
+    * Added new IP defragmentation preprocessor, Frag3. The frag3 preprocessor 
+      is a target-based IP defragmentation module, and is intended as a 
+      replacement for the frag2 module.  Check out the README.frag3 for full
+      info on this new preprocessor.
+
+    * Libprelude support has been added (enable with --enable-prelude).
+      Thanks Yoann Vandoorselaere!
+
+    * An "ftpbounce" rule detection plugin was added for easier detection of
+      FTP bounce attacks.
+
+    * Added a new Snort config option, "ignore_ports," to ignore packets
+      based on port number.  This is similar to bpf filters, but done within
+      snort.conf.
+
+[*] Improvements
+    * Snort startup messages printed in syslog now contain a PID before each
+      entry. Thanks Sekure for initially bringing this up.
+
+    * Stream4: Performance improvements.
+    
+    * Stream4: Added 'max_session_limit' option which limits number of 
+      concurrent sessions tracked.  Added favor_old/favor_new options that 
+      affect order in which packets are put together for reassembly.  
+
+    * Stream4: New configuration options to manage flushpoints for improved
+      anti-evasion.  The flush_behavior option selects flushpoint management 
+      mode.  New flush_base, flush_range, and flush_seed manage randomized 
+      flushing.  Check out the snort.conf file for full config data on the 
+      new flush options. 
+
+    * Added two more alerts for BackOrifice client and server packets. This
+      allows specific alerts to be suppressed.
+
+    * PerfMon preprocessor updated to include more detailed stats for rebuilt
+      packets (applayer, wire, fragmented & TCP). Also added 'atexitonly'
+      option that dumps stats at exit of snort, and command line -Z flag to
+      specify the file to which stats are logged.
+
+    * Added new Http Inspect config item, "tab_uri_delimiter," which if
+      specified, lets a tab character (0x09) act as the delimiter for a URI.
+
+    * Added a '-G' command line flag to snort that specifies the Snort
+      instance log identifier. It takes a single argument that can be either
+      hex (prefaced with 0x) or decimal. The unified log files will include
+      the instance ID when the -G flag is used.
+
+    * "Same SRC/DST" (sid 527) and "Loopback Traffic" (sid 528) are now
+      handled in the IP decoder. Those sids are now considered obsolete.
+
+    * Http_Inspect "flow_depth" option now accepts a -1 value which tells
+      Snort to ignore all server-side traffic.
+
+    * RPMs have been updated to be more portable, and also now include a
+      "--with inline" option for those wanting to build Inline RPMs. Thanks
+      Daniel Wittenberg and JP Vossen for your help!
+
+    * Many, many bug fixes have also gone into this release, please see the
+      ChangeLog for details.
