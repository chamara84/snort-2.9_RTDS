--
Summary:
This event is generated when a pong packet for the Trinoo (aka trin00) 
DDos suite is detected.

--
Impact:
This may indicate a compromised system or be the prelude to a
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

--
Detailed Information:
Once a Trinoo client has been installed on a compromised machine and a master is
ready and listening, the master sends a "png" (ping) command to its drones in 
an attempt to enumerate the drone network. A functioning client will respond to 
port 31335/udp with the text "PONG".

Once a machine becomes part of a trin00 network, a Denial of Service (DoS) 
is typically initiated against one (or more) victim machines.

--
Affected Systems:
 
--
Attack Scenarios:
As part of a large scale attack against a machine or a network, an
attacker will compromise large numbers of machines which will form the
army that the trin00 master daemon will command.  The master daemon
typically instructs the clients to send mass-quantities of packets to
a set of victim hosts.  If the traffic is sufficient, the victim
machines will become resource deprived and thus endure a DoS condition.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Trinoo client and master programs are widely available.

--
False Positives:
None Known

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:
Disconnect infected machine(s) from the network immediately.

Use software to determine if a host has been compromised using a
rootkit.
