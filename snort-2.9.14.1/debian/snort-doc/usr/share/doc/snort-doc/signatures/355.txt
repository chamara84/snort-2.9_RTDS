--
Impact:
Remote root access.  The attack may indicate that the FTP server has been compromised. 

--
Detailed Information:
The password "wh00t" is a common backdoor password associated with a compromised root account.  If this password is observed, it may indicate that the FTP server has been compromised and a backdoor root account with a password of "wh00t" has been created.  Alternately, this may indicate a failed attempt of an attacker attempting to locate FTP servers compromised by others. 

--
Affected Systems:
FTP servers.

--
Corrective Action:
Examine the suspected compromised host for unauthorized changes.
