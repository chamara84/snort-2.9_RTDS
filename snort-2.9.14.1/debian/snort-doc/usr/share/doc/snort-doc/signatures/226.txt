Sid:
226

--
Summary:
This event indicates that a Stacheldraht handler exists on the source host and an agent on the destination host.

--
Impact:
Serious. A Distributed Denial of Service attack maybe in progress.

--
Detailed Information:
The Stacheldraht DDoS uses a tiered structure of compromised hosts to 
coordinate and participate in a denial of service attack.  There are 
"handler" hosts that are used to coordinate the attacks and "agent" 
hosts that launch the attack.  When a host becomes a Stacheldraht agent 
it makes an initial contact with each of its known handlers.  A handler 
should respond with an ICMP echo reply with an ICMP identification 
number of 667 and a string of "ficken" in the payload. 

--
Affected Systems:
Any Stacheldraht compromised host.

--
Attack Scenarios:
A host on which a Stacheldraht agent has been installed attempts to 
contact the list of known handlers.   

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Stacheldraht code is freely available.

--
False Positives:
None Known.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

--
Corrective Action:
Turn of all unnecessary services on hosts.

Upgrade to the latest patch level.

Use a packet filtering firewall to block inappropriate traffic to the network to prevent hosts from being compromised.
