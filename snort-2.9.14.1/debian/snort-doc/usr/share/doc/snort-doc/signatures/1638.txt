Rule:

--
Sid:
1638

--
Summary:
This event is generated when a scan for the version of an ssh daemon is
detected.

--
Impact:
Information gathering.

--
Detailed Information:
This event indicates that an attempt has been made to scan a host. In
particular an attempt has been made to scan for the version of the ssh
daemon on the target host.

This may be the prelude to an attack. Scanners are used to ascertain
which ports a host may be listening on, whether or not the ports are
filtered by a firewall and if the host is vulnerable to a particular
exploit.

--
Affected Systems:
	Any host using the ssh daemon.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can determine if a vulnerable version of ssh is being used
on a host, then proceed to exploit that vulnerablity.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
A scanner may be used in a security audit.

--
False Negatives:
If the scanning tool does not send an identification string this rule
will not generate an event.

--
Corrective Action:
Determine whether or not the scan was legitimate then look for other
events concerning the attacking IP address.

Check the host for signs of compromise.
