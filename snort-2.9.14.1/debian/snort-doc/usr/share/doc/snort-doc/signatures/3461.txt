--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to overflow a buffer
using the Content-Type parameter.

--
Impact:
Serious. Code execution is possible.

--
Detailed Information:
Internet Explorer does not correctly handle Content-Type or
Content-Encoding headers returned from a server. It is possible to
overflow a static buffer in urlmon.dll by supplying more than 300 bytes
of data in the parameter for those headers.

Specifically the error occurs when an image tag <img> is used to pass
the excess data to both those header fields in a server response. Since
some email clients use Internet Explorer to process HTML email messages,
it is also possible to cause this overflow to occur via email.

--
Affected Systems:
	Microsoft Windows systems

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can supply a malicious HTML file to a mail client containing
excess data in the Content-Type and Content-Encoding headers that will
overflow the buffer presenting them with the opportunity to write to
various parts of memory and possibly execute code of their choosing.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploit code is publicly available.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.
