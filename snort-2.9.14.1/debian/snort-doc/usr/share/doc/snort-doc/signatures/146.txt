Summary:
Netsphere is a Trojan Horse offering the attacker access to the victims 
filesystem, instant messaging clients and some control over peripherals.
This event is generated when a Netsphere server responds to an attackers
client.

--
Impact:
Compromise of data integrity on the victim host as well as the 
possibility of rendering the machine temporarily unusable.

--
Detailed Information:
This Trojan affects the following operating systems:

	Windows 95
	Windows 98
	Windows ME

The Trojan changes system registry settings to add the Netsphere
sever to programs normally started on boot. Due to the nature of this
Trojan it is unlikely that the attacker's client IP address has been
spoofed.

The Trojan also gives the attacker the ability to access the victims 
filesystem, turn the monitor on and off, control the mouse, access 
instant messaging applications and render a pentium based machine 
unusable.

The Trojan is also known to use TCP ports 30100, 30101 and 30102.

--
Attack Scenarios:
This Trojan may be delivered to the target in a number of ways. This
event is indicative of an existing infection being activated. Initial
compromise can be in the form of a Win32 installation program that may
use the extension ".jpg" or ".bmp" when delivered via e-mail for
example.

--
Ease of Attack:
This is Trojan activity, the target machine may already be compromised.
Updated virus definition files are essential in detecting this Trojan.

The Trojan server is named NetSphereServer.exe.
