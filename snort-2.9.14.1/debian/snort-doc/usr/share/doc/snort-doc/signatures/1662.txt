Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to access the home directory of the ftp user via http.

--
Impact:
Medium - Possible unauthorized file access due a configuration error

--
Detailed Information:
The FTP server might block access on ftp homedir to (anonymous) users, 
but the folder can be read using the webserver.

Apache UserDir module allows sharing home directory (sub-)folders, a 
misconfiguration of the webserver or ftp user account may allow 
unauthorized access to the ftp user directory.

--
Attack Scenarios:
A FTP server blocks access to the ftp users homedir. A misconfiguration might allow an attacker to access the ftp users home directory.

This home folder might contain critical files.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known

--
False Negatives:
None known

--
Corrective Action:
Visit http://httpd.apache.org/docs for UserDir configuration options or 
remove UserDir module if not needed.

Configure the ftp user to use a non-interactive nologin shell that does 
not require a home directory.
