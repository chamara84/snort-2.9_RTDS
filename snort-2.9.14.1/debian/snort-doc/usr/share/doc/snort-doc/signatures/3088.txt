--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a client buffer
overflow associated with Winamp's processing of a filename with an
extension of .cda.

--
Impact:
A successful attack may permit a buffer overflow that allows the execution
of arbitrary code at the privilege level of the user running Winamp.

--
Detailed Information:
Winamp is a media file player for Windows developed by Nullsoft.  A buffer
overflow exists because of insufficient bounds checking while handling the
name of a CD audio format file (.cda extension) or a playlist that contains
a filename with a .cda extension.  An overly long name may cause the buffer
overflow permitting the execution of arbitrary code at the privilege level
of the user running Winamp.

--
Affected Systems:
	Winamp 3.x, and 5.x

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can create and send a malformed .cda filename that may cause
a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code on the
vulnerable host.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.
