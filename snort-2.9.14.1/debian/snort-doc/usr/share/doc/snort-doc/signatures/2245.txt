Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known vulnerability in NetWin WebNEWS.

--
Impact:
Execution of arbitrary code. Possible unauthorized access to the target 
host.

--
Detailed Information:
WebNEWS allows access to news groups via a web interface. Certain 
versions of the application suffer from a buffer overflow condition such
that a user supplied group name longer than 1500 characters may allow 
the attacker to execute code of his choosing with the privileges of the 
user running the web server.

--
Affected Systems:
	NetWin WebNEWS 1.1 j
	NetWin WebNEWS 1.1 i
	NetWin WebNEWS 1.1 h

--
Attack Scenarios:
The attacker would need to supply a long news group name of over 1500 
characters to cause the overflow which may then present the attacker 
with the opportunity to execute code.

--
Ease of Attack:
Moderate.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.
