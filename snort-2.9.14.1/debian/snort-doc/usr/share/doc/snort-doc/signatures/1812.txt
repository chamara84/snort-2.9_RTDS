System compromize presenting the attacker with either the opportunity to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the SSH daemon (usually root) or a possible Denial of Service (DoS).

--
Detailed Information:
OpenSSH versions prior to 3.3 contain a flaw that could allow a remote attacker to compromise a vulnerable SSH daemon via an integer overflow on systems with BSD_AUTH or SKEY options compiled and PAM authentication or Challenge Response Authentication enabled.

Affected Systems:
	OpenSSH versions 2.9 to 3.2

--
Attack Scenarios:
Exploit scripts are available

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploits are available.

--
False Positives:
None Known

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.
