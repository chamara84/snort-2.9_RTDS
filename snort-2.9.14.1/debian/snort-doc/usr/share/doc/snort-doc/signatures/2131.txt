Rule:
--
Sid: 2131

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to access 
/iisprotect/admin on a host running Microsoft Internet Information 
Server (IIS).

--
Impact:
An attacker may be able to perform administrative tasks on the server 
without authorization and may be able to manipulate the database that 
IISProtect by injecting and executing SQL statements.

--
Detailed Information:
IISProtect is a third-party application that provides password 
authentication to directories on IIS using a Web-based interface. An 
attacker can bypass authentication by requesting a specific file with an
encoded URI, and can then proceed to use SQL injection techniques to 
execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges.

--
Affected Systems:
Any host using any version of IISProtect below v2.2.0.9 with IIS.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can use SQL injection to execute arbitrary code.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
If a legitimate remote user accesses the IISProtect administration site,
this rule may generate an event.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.

Check the host for signs of compromise.

Disallow access to the IISProtect administration site from sources 
external to the protected network.
