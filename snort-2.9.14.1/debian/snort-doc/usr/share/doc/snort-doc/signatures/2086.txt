Rule:

--
Sid:
2086

--
Summary:
parse_xml.cgi script on a webserver via the quicktime streaming port.

--
Impact:
Arbitrary code execution, information disclosure and possible cross site
scripting.

--
Detailed Information:
Multiple vulnerabilities exist in Apple Quick Time Streaming Server and 
Apple Darwin Streamin Server, such that an attacker can gain information
on the file system as an intelligence gathering activity for an attack 
on vulnerable services.

It is also possible for an attacker to inject malicious code into the 
log file for the server, the impact of this would be to execute the code
when viewed by the administrator.

It is also directly vulnerable to cross site scripting issues.

--
Affected Systems:
	Apple Darwin Streaming Server 4.1.2
	Apple Quicktime Streaming Server 4.1.1

--
Attack Scenarios:
In the case of injecting code to the log files, the attacker would need 
to make requests to the streaming server with the code inserted in the 
request.

The attacker can execute an attack on the file system contents using a 
browser, the attacker needs to include a NULL byte in the request to 
reveal the directory structure.

The cross site scripting issue does not need anything specific to be 
done.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple

--
False Positives:
None Known

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:
Apply the appropriate patches for the systems affected.

Upgrade to the latest non affected versions of the software.
