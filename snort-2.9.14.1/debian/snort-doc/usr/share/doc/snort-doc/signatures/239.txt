Rule:

--
Sid:
239

--
Summary:
This event is generated when a DDoS Shaft handler communicates with a Shaft agent.  It is also possible that this event may be generated when any host attempts to discover a Shaft agent.   

--
Impact:
Attempted DDoS. If the listed source IP is in your network, it may be a Shaft handler or a host attempting to discover Shaft agents.  If the listed destination IP is in your network, it may be a Shaft agent.

--
Detailed Information:
The Shaft DDoS uses a tiered structure of compromised hosts to coordinate and participate in a distributed denial of service attack. Handlers communicate with agents to direct them to launch attacks. A handler may communicate with an agent using a UDP packet to destination port 18753 with a content of "alive tijgu.  This communication checks if an agent is alive and uses a default password of "tijgu".

--
Affected Systems:
Any Shaft compromised host.

--
Attack Scenarios:
A Shaft handler needs to discover if an agent is alive before directing it to launch an attack.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Shaft code is freely available.

--
False Positives:
None Known.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

--
Corrective Action:
Perform proper forensic analysis on the suspected compromised host to discover the means of compromise.

Rebuild a confirmed compromised host.

Use a packet-filtering firewall to block inappropriate traffic to the network to prevent hosts from being compromised.
