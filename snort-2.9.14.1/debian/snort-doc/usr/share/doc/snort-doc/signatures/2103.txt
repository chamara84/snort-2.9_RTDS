Summary:

A buffer overflow exists in the Samba file and print sharing software 
that can allow a remote attacker to gain root privileges on the target 
script to exploit this vulnerability.

--
Impact:

An attacker can cause the target system running Samba to overflow a 
buffer presenting the attacker with root privileges.

--
Detailed Information:
It is possible for an anonymous user to cause a buffer overflow in a 
character array by sending data greater than 1024 bytes to the variable 
pname. This information is copied by another function causing the buffer
overflow.

Affected Systems:
Samba versions 2.2.5 to 2.2.8

may indicate an attacker verifying the root shell.

--
Attack Scenarios:
The attacker needs to send pname a value larger than 1024 bytes.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple, an exploit script exists.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
No false negatives are known at this time.

--
Corrective Action:
