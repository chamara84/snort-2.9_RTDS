Sid:
2583

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a vulnerability
associated with CVS.

--
Impact:
A successful attack may perform a buffer overflow or a denial of service by
either causing the CVS server to terminate abruptly or causing an exhaustion of
disk resources.

--
Detailed Information:
A CVS client transaction may reference a file using a relative path
requiring the use of a directory traversal.  The Max-dotdot keyword and
appropriate argument are created by the CVS client software to handle
relative paths.  The appropriate argument represents the maximum number of
directory levels to be traversed.  It is possible for an attacker
to supply an overly large value to the Max-dotdot keyword, causing an
incorrect allocation of memory and possibly causing a buffer overflow or the CVS
server to crash.  In addition, temporary files are not deleted enabling a disk
resource exhaustion attack, if repeated many times.  It should be noted
that an attacker must have CVS access privileges in order to attempt
these attacks.


--
Affected Systems:
CVS versions 1.12.8 with the exception of version 1.11.17

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can connect to a CVS server and craft an overly large Max-dotdot
argument value, causing a buffer overflow or causing the vulnerable CVS server
to crash.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.
