--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to access edit_action.cgi on an internal web server. This may indicate an attempt to exploit a directory traversal vulnerability in Webmin 0.91.

--
Impact:
Information gathering, possible execution of system utilities to which Webmin has rights.

--
Detailed Information:
Webmin is a web-based system administration tool for Linux and UNIX-based operating systems. A malicious user could use directory traversal techniques within an argument sent to the edit_action.cgi script in order to view hidden files on the server or execute programs to which Webmin has security privileges. 

--
Affected Systems:
Systems running Webmin 0.91.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker creates a specially crafted an edit_action.cgi URL and transmits it to a vulnerable server. The attacker can then view or execute any arbitrary file included in the parameter, provided that Webmin has rights to access it. 

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. A proof of concept exists.

--
False Positives:
If a legitimate remote user accesses edit_action.cgi, this rule may generate an event.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to Webmin 0.92 or higher.
