Sid:
124-1

--
Summary:
This event is generated when the pre-processor xlink2state
detects network traffic that may constitute an attack. Specifically this
event is generated when an attempt is made to overflow a static buffer
associated with the extended verb "X-LINK2STATE" in a possible attempt
to exploit a known vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange Server.

--
Impact:
Execution of arbitrary code leading to full administrator access of the 
machine. Denial of Service (DoS).

--
Detailed Information:
Microsoft Exchange Servers are able to use extensions to the SMTP
protocol to help communicate between Exchange servers. The
"X-Link2State" verb is used to share routing information between
Exchange servers.

A buffer overflow condition in the processing of this command may
present an attacker with the opportunity to execute code of their
choosing on an affected host.

While some of the extended verbs can be disabled easily by an
Administrator, this particular command cannot. The affected dynamic link
library (DLL) must be unregistered. Refer to MS05-021 for details on how
to unregister the DLL.

--
Affected Systems:
	Microsoft Exchange Server 2000 sp3
	Microsoft Exchange Server 2003
	Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 sp1

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can supply a malicious verb request using the "X-Link2State"
verb to cause a buffer overflow.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploit code exists.

--
False Positives:
This event will generate events in an environment where the use of
extended verbs between Exchange servers is commonplace.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches.

Disable the use of the Microsoft SMTP extensions.
