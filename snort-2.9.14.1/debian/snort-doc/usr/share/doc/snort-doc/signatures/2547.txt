Sid:
2547

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a vulnerability
associated with the web interface support for the HP JetAdmin printer.

--
Impact:
A successful attack may allow the execution of arbitrary code as root 
on a vulnerable server.

--
Detailed Information:
The HP Web JetAdmin provides a web interface for the administration of the HP
Web JetAdmin printer.  A vulnerability exists that allows the uploading
of unauthorized files using the script 
/plugins/hpjwja/script/devices_update_printer_fw_upload.hts.  This capability
was included to allow the upload of legitimate files, such as firmware updates,
by an authorized administrator.  However, there is no file validation on the
uploaded file, allowing the upload of any random file.  An attacker can upload
a file with a .hts extension that subsequently can be executed when the
attacker accesses the file using a web browser.

--
Affected Systems:
HP Web JetAdmin 7.2.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can create upload and execute a malicious file on a vulnerable server. 

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. 

--
False Positives:
An authorized administrator who uploads a file from an IP address outside the trusted
network will cause a false positive alert.

--
False Negatives:
The default HP Web JetAdmin port is 8000.  If an administrator selects a different port
on which to run the web interface, no alert will be detected.  In that case, the rule
should be altered to reflect the port on which the web interface runs.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software or apply the appropriate patch
when it becomes available.
