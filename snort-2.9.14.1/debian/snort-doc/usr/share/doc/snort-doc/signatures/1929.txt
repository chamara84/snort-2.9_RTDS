Sid:
1929

--
Summary:
This event is generated when  an attacker attempts to connect to a 
Trojan server installed via compromised tcpdump or libpcap sources.

--
Impact:
Control of the victim host.

--
Detailed Information:
This Trojan affects UNIX operating systems:

Some versions of tcpdump and libpcap were compromised and Trojan code 
inserted into the source. The compromise is similar to that which 
affected OpenSSH.

Libpcap is a library used for capturing packets in Snort and other 
packet sniffing tools.

The Trojaned libpcap source contains code in the configure script that 
connects to a server at 212.146.0.34 on port 1963. The script then 
downloads source code for a Trojan horse and compiles it.

Tcpdump is a tool that is used for capturing network traffic, it 
utilizes libpcap. Some versions of tcpdump also contain the same Trojan.

Due to the nature of this Trojan it is unlikely that the attacker's 
client IP address has been spoofed.

--
Attack Scenarios:
This Trojan is delivered to the target via the configure script.

--
Ease of Attack:
This is Trojan activity, the target machine may already be compromised.

--
False Positives:
None Known

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:
Delete the Trojan and kill any associated processes.

Restore the system from known good backups.

Download non-trojaned versions of the library and re-compile.
