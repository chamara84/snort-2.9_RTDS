Rule:

--

Sid:
471

--

Summary:
This event is generated when Icmpenum v1.1.1 generates an ICMP datagram.

--

Impact:
ICMP echo requests are used to determine if a host is running at a
specific IP address.  A remote attacker can scan a large range of hosts
using ICMP echo requests to determine what hosts are operational on the
network.

--

Detailed Information:
Icmpenum v1.1.1 generates an ICMP Type 0 datagram with an ICMP ID of 666, an ICMP
sequence number of 0, and an ICMP datagram size of 0.  

--

Attack Scenarios:
A remote attacker might scan a large range of hosts using ICMP echo
requests to determine what hosts are operational on the network.

--

Ease of Attack:
Simple.  Packet generation tools can generate this type of ICMP packet

--

False Positives:
None known

--

False Negatives:
Packet generation tools can generate ICMP Echo requests with
user-defined payloads that emulate this application.

--

Corrective Action:
To prevent information gathering, use ingress filtering to block
incoming ICMP Type 8 Code 0 traffic.
