Sid:
867

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit an 
authentication vulnerability in a web server or an application running
on that server.

--
Impact:
Information gathering and system integrity compromise. Possible unauthorized
administrative access to the server or application.

--
Detailed Information:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to gain unauthorized
access to a web server or an application running ona web server. Some
applications do not perform stringent checks when validating the
credentials of a client host connecting to the services offered on a
host server. This can lead to unauthorized access and possibly escalated
privileges to that of the administrator. Data stored on the machine can
be compromised and trust relationships between the victim server and
other hosts can be exploited by the attacker.

--
Affected Systems:

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can access the authentication mechanism and supply his/her
own credentials to gain access. Alternatively the attacker can exploit
weaknesses to gain access as the administrator.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploits exist.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Disallow administrative access from sources external to the protected
network.

Ensure the system is using an up to date version of the software and has
had all vendor supplied patches applied.
