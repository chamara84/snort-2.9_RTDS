Sid:
1340

--
Summary:
Attempted tfp command access via web

--
Impact:
Possible attempt to gain information using the Trivial File Transfer
Protocol (tfp) to  access sensitive files on a webserver. It is also
possible that an  attempt is being made to remotely boot or reboot a
device using  tfp.

--
Detailed Information:
This is an attempt to gain intelligence from sensitive system files on a
webserver.  Tftp is a variation of the File Transfer Protocol that can
be used to  transfer files from one host to another, one feature it has
is that it  can be used to boot or reboot various network devices
without authentication  being needed. The attacker could possibly gain
information needed  for other attacks on the system, including the
retrieval of password  files.

--
Attack Scenarios:
The attacker can make a standard HTTP request that contains 'tfp' in the
URI which can  then return requested files to an external server.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple HTTP request.

--
False Positives:
None Known

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:

Webservers should not be allowed to view or execute files and binaries
outside  of it's designated web root or cgi-bin. This command may also
be requested  on a command line should the attacker gain access to the
machine.  Non-essential binaries should be removed from a webserver once
it is in  production.
