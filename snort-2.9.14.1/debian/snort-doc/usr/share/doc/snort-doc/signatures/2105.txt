Sid:
2105

--
Summary:
This event is generated when a remote user uses the IMAP AUTHENTICATE
command to send a suspiciously long string to port 143 on an internal
server. This may indicate an attempt to exploit a buffer overflow
vulnerability in the IMAP AUTHENTICATE command. This vulnerability may
affect other IMAP implementations.

--
Impact:
Serious. Possible remote execution of arbitrary code, which may lead to
a remote root compromise.

--
Detailed Information:
When a large amount of data is sent to a vulnerable IMAP server in the
AUTHENTICATE command, a buffer overflow condition may occur. This can
allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code, which may allow the
attacker to gain root access to the compromised server.

--
Affected Systems:
	University of Washington imapd version 10.234 and earlier.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can send a sufficiently long AUTHENTICATE command to the
IMAP server, creating a buffer overflow condition. This can then allow
the attacker to gain root access to the compromised server.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploits exist.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.

Apply the appropriate patches for your operating system.

Check the host for signs of compromise.
