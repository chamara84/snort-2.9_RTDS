Rule:

--
Sid:
2183

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known 
vulnerability in certain versions of Sendmail.

--
Impact:
Denial of Service (DoS), possible arbitrary code execution and the 
remote attacker can gain access to a machine with the credentials of
the user running the Sendmail daemon, usually 'root'.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the Sendmail MTA Daemon that could allow an
attacker the opportunity to gain root access.

A programming error exists such that a buffer overflow can be caused
using the header fields in an SMTP session. The prescan() function does 
not properly handle certain conversions from character and integer 
types. This can cause Sendmail to interpret the value as a special 
control value (NOCHAR).

This rule detects specific exploit code attacks against a server using 
Sendmail.

--
Affected Systems:
	Sendmail Pro (all versions)
	Sendmail Switch 2.1 prior to 2.1.6
	Sendmail Switch 2.2 prior to 2.2.6
	Sendmail Switch 3.0 prior to 3.0.4
	Sendmail for NT 2.X prior to 2.6.3
	Sendmail for NT 3.0 prior to 3.0.4
	Systems running open-source sendmail versions prior to 8.12.9, including UNIX and Linux systems

--
Attack Scenarios:
The attacker merely needs to execute one of the available exploit 
scripts.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploits for this vulnerability exist.

--
False Positives:
None Known.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest version of the software.

Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches.
