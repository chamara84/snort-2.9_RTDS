Sid:
1821

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known
vulnerability in dvips on some RedHat Linux systems.

--
Impact:
Execution of commands with the privileges of the lp daemon.

--
Detailed Information:
dvips is used to convert DVI documents into PostScript format for
printing. The line printer daemon may use dvips to print DVI documents
using a filter.

A configuration error in some distributions of RedHat Linux allows a
remote attacker to execute commands via this utility.

--
Affected Systems:
	RedHat Linux 6.2, 7.0 and 7.1

--
Attack Scenarios:
The attacker can place the commands to be excuted in a DVI file and send
that to the lp daemon.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. No exploit software is required.

--
False Positives:
None Known

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.


Ensure that dvips is executed in safe mode by the lp daemon by
specifying the use of the -R flag in the dvi-to-ps.fpi configuration file.
