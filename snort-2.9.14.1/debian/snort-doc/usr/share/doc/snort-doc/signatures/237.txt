--
Sid:
237

--
Summary:
This event is generated when a trinoo DDoS master host communicates with a daemon host.

--
Impact:
Attempted DDoS. If the listed source IP is in your network, it may be a trinoo master. If the listed destination IP is in your network, it may be a trinoo daemon.

--
Detailed Information:
The trinoo DDoS uses a tiered structure of compromised hosts to coordinate and participate in a distributed denial of service attack. Masters communicate with daemons to direct them to launch attacks.  A master may communicate with a daemon via UDP destination port 27444 with a string of "l44adsl" in the payload.  This string is the default password for the daemon.

--
Affected Systems:
Any trinoo compromised host.

--
Attack Scenarios:
A trinoo master will communicate with a daemon to direct it to launch attacks.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. trinoo code is freely available.

--
False Positives:
None Known.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

--
Corrective Action:
Perform proper forensic analysis on the suspected compromised host to discover the means of compromise.

Rebuild a confirmed compromised host.

Use a packet-filtering firewall to block inappropriate traffic to the network to prevent hosts from being compromised.
