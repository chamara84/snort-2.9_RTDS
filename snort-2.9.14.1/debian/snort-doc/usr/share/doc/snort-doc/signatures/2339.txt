Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known
vulnerability in Verilink Netengine Broadband Routers.

--
Impact:
Denial of Service (DoS)

Detailed Information:
TFTP is used to transfer files between hosts. This event is indicative of spurious
activity in TFTP traffic from a host to a router.

It is possible for an attacker to expoit a DoS condition in
Netengine routers. If a UDP packet containing a double-null opcode is
sent to the router's TFTP port the router may crash, thus causing the
DoS.
