Sid:
1421

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to attack a device using
SNMP v1.

--
Impact:
Varies depending on the implementation. Ranges from Denial of Service 
(DoS) to code execution.

--
Detailed Information:
SNMP is a widely adopted protocol for managing IP networks, including 
individual network devices, and devices in aggregate. 

Several network devices come pre-installed with this protocol for 
management and monitoring.

A number of vulnerabilities exist in SNMP v1, including a community 
string buffer overflow, that will allow an attacker to execute arbitrary
code or shutdown the service.

--
Affected Systems:
Any implementation of the SNMP v1 protocol

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker needs to send a specially crafted packet to UDP port 705
of a vulnerable device, causing a Denial of Service or possible 
execution of arbitrary code.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Disable the SNMP v1 protocol, use SNMP v2 protocol as an alternative.

Disable the use of SNMP for devices that do not need it.

Use Ingress/Egress filtering on a packet filtering firewall.
