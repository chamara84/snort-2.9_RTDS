Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to ascertain the status of the Apache module mod_gzip on a host. 

--
Impact:
Information gathering.

--
Detailed Information:
This event indicates that an attempt has been made to ascertain the status of the Apache module mod_gzip on a host from a source external to the protected network.

mod_gzip is used to compress data sent by an Apache webserver in an attempt to preserve bandwidth and speed up communications between client and server.

The attacker may be trying to gain information on the server by making a query to the mod_gzip_status page. This could lead to information disclusure which might then be used in further attacks against that host.

--
Affected Systems:
Any host using the Apache module mod_gzip.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can retrieve information on the server by making a request for the status of mod_gzip. This request would take the form http://www.foo.com/mod_gzip_status

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. No exploit required.

--
False Positives:
The event will also be generated if Nessus is used to scan the host for this vulnerability.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

--
Corrective Action:
Disable the mod_gzip module.

Disallow access to mod_gzip_status from sources external to the protected network.

Use the Apache directive <Location> to disallow access to the mod_gzip status page to the localhost only in the following manner:

<Location /mod_gzip_status>
    Order deny,allow
    Deny from all
    Allow from localhost
</Location>
