--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to access fileseek.cgi on an internal web server. This may indicate an attempt to exploit a directory traversal or remote command execution vulnerability in Wiley Computer Publishing Craig Patchett FileSeek.cgi.

--
Impact:
Information gathering or remote execution of arbitrary code.

--
Detailed Information:
FileSeek.cgi is an example script that locates and downloads files on a web server, available in "The CGI/Perl Cookbook," written by Craig Patchett and published by John Wiley & Sons. It contains two vulnerabilities due to erroneous parsing -- an attacker could use "....//" in the HEAD or FOOT parameter of an HTTP request to fileseek.cgi to view arbitrary files on the server or could use a similar method to execute shell commands on the web server. Both actions will be performed with the security context of the web server.

--
Affected Systems:
Any web server running fileseek.cgi.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request to a vulnerable web server, and is then able to view files on the server. In addition, an attacker could send a specially crafted HTTP request that contains shell commands to the web server. The web server would then attempt to execute the commands in the request.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploits exist.

--
False Positives:
If a legitimate remote user accesses fileseek.cgi, this rule may generate an event.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
