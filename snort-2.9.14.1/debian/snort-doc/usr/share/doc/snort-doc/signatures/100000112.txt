Summary: 
This event is generated when the readfile.tcl script on a Nokia IPSO device is

Impact: 
Since the script does not perform any input validation, users can read any file 
on the host operating system for which the script has permissions. 

--
Detailed Information:
An attacker may specify any file on the host operating system, and if the 
script has read permissions for that file, it will be displayed in the web 
browser. Users must be able to log into the Nokia web gui to perform this
