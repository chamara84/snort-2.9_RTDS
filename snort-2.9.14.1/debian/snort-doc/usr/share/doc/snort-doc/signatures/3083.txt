Affected Systems:

Attack Scenarios: 
The victim must first install the server. Be wary of suspicious files because they often can be backdoors in disguise.
Once the victim mistakenly installs the server program, the attacker usually will employ an IP scanner program
to find the IP addresses of victims that have installed the program. Then the attacker enters the IP address and 
presses the connect button and he has access to your computer.

HKEY_USERS\Default\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

Reboot the computer or close Dcomcnofg.exe.

Delete Dcomcnofg.exe from the windows system directory.
