Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known
vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange Server.

--
Impact:
Serious. Possible execution of arbitrary code and Denial of Service
(DoS).

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in versions of Microsoft Exchange Server such
that it is possible for an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a
DoS condition on the server without the need for prior authentication as
a valid user.

It is possible for an attacker to connect to the Exchange server on port
25 and send an extended verb request to the server that will cause a
large amount of memory to be allocated. In Exchange Server 5.5 this may
cause a DoS, whilst in Exchange Server 2000 this same condition could
present the attacker with an opportunity to execute arbitrary code.

--
Affected Systems:
	MIcrosoft Exchange Server 5.5
	Microsoft Exchange Server 2000

--
Attack Scenarios:
The attacker can connect to port 25 of the server and send a specially
crafted verb request.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.

Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches.
