Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known 
vulnerability in a web server using the TRACE command.

--
Impact:
Possible disclosure of information.

--
Detailed Information:
The TRACE method is used when debugging a webserver to ensure that 
server returns information to the client correctly. When used with other
vulnerabilities it is possible to use the TRACE method to return 
sensitive information from a webserver such as authentication data and 
cookies.

This is known as a Cross Site Tracing (XST) attack.

--
Affected Systems:
All platforms running a webserver that responds to the TRACE method.

--
Attack Scenarios:
The attacker needs to perform a TRACE request to a vulnerable server.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple

--
False Positives:
The TRACE method is legitimate and may be used to debug a webserver or 
can be used to debug other networking equipment.

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:
Disable the webserver from responding to TRACE requests.
