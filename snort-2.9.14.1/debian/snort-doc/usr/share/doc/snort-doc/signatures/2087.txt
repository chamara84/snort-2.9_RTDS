Summary:
vulnerability in Sendmail.

--
Impact:
The remote attacker can gain access to a machine with the credentials of
the user running the Sendmail daemon, usually 'root'.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the Sendmail MTA Daemon that could allow an
attacker the opportunity to gain root access.

A programming error exists such that a buffer overflow can be caused
using the header fields in an SMTP session. Using the '<' and '>'

the extent that the buffer exceeds it's limit.

--
Attack Scenarios:
The attacker can craft an email message that contains a "from" header
with enough sequences of "<>" to cause a counter to exceed it's maximum
size thus causing the buffer overflow.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple

--
False Positives:
None Known

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:
All users of Sendmail should upgrade to the latest non-affected version
