--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a buffer 
overflow vulnerability using the LIST command on mail servers running 
the qpopper daemon.

--
Impact: Remote Access. 
This attack can allow an attacker to read other users mail as the Group 
ID mail.

--
Detailed Information: 
The attacker needs the username and password of a POP account on the 
server.  After a successful POP login, the attacker can cause a buffer 
overflow using the LIST command.  After successfully exploiting the 
qpopper daemon the attacker has remote access of the server with the UID
of the username used for the POP login and the GID of 'mail'.

--
Affected Systems: 
	Qualcomm qpopper 3.0 and 3.0 beta 1 through beta 29.

--
Attack Scenarios: 
An attacker can log in to a vulnerable mail server using a preexisting 
POP account and enter an overly long argument with the LIST command, 
causing a buffer overflow which may then result in remote access.

--
Ease of Attack: 
Simple.  Exploits exist.

--
False Positives: 
None known.

--
False Negatives: 
None Known.

--
Corrective Action: 
Upgrade to Qualcomm qpopper 3.0 beta 30 or higher.
