Sid:
3150

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a
vulnerability in Microsoft Windows SQL Server.

--
Impact:
Serious. Code execution is possible leading to unauthorized
administrative access to the target host. Denial of Service (DoS) is
also possible.

--
Detailed Information:
Microsoft Windows SQL Server 2000 uses the SQLXML component to process
database queries via XML.

Due to a programming error a buffer overrun condition is present in the
SQLXML ISAPI component that processes the XML queries via HTTP. The
overrun condition can be exploited by manipulating the contenttype
variable used to control the Content-Type header. The ISAPI extension
does not correctly check the length of the contenttype parameter. It may
be possible for an attacker with user privileges on the target host to
exploit the condition by supplying extra data in the affected parameter.

--
Affected Systems:
	Microsoft SQL Server 2000

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can overflow a buffer by inserting extra data into the
contenttype parameter of a malicious XML query. The attacker may then
insert code of their choosing to either run commands on the system or
execute the code with the privileges of the administrative account.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Ensure the system is using an up to date version of the software and has
had all vendor supplied patches applied.
