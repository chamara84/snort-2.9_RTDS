--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a heap overflow
associated with Apache 1.3 proxy and cache module.

--
Impact:
A successful attack may cause a heap overflow, permitting the execution of
arbitrary code.

--
Detailed Information:
When Apache 1.3 is used and the host is configured to be a web proxy,
reverse proxy and/or cache server, a vulnerability exists that may
allow a heap overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code
on the vulnerable server.  This may occur when the server receives
a malformed response from a malicious web server that includes a
negative content length value.  This can cause invalid memory access
and a denial of service or heap overflow.

--
Affected Systems:
Apache 1.3.x

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can entice a user to visit a malicious web server.  If
a vulnerable server proxies the request and receives a malformed
response, a heap overflow may occur.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploit code is publicly available.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.
