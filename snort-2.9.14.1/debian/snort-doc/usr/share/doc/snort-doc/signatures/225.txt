--
Sid:
225

--
Summary:
This event is generated when the Stacheldraht DDoS tool is used.

--
Impact:
This indicates that a Stacheldraht agent exists on the source host and a handler exists on the destination host.

--
Detailed Information:
The Stacheldraht DDoS uses a tiered structure of compromised hosts to coordinate and participate in a denial of service attack.  There are "handler" hosts that are used to coordinate the attacks and "agent" hosts that launch the attack.  A handler may probe for a Stacheldraht agent.  There is also "gag" program used to scan for Stacheldraht agents.  A response to a "gag" request will be an ICMP echo reply with an ICMP identification number of 669 and a string of "sicken" in the payload.  

--
Affected Systems:
Any Stacheldraht compromised host.

--
Attack Scenarios:
A handler may probe for a Stacheldraht agent or the "gag" program can be used to discover Stacheldraht agents.  The "gag" program can be run by a defender of a network if there is a suspected Stacheldraht agent on the network. An attacker could also run the "gag" program to find an agent.


--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. The "gag" script is freely available.

--
False Positives:
None Known.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

--
Corrective Action:
Turn of all unnecessary services on hosts.

Upgrade to the latest patch level.

Use a packet filtering firewall to block inappropriate traffic to the network to prevent hosts from being compromised.
