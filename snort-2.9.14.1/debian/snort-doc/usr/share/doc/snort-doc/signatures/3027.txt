3027

-- 
Summary: 
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known
vulnerability in a Samba implementation.

-- 
Impact: 
Serious. Possible execution of arbitrary code.

--
Detailed Information:
Samba is a file and print serving system for heterogenous networks. It
is available for use as a service and client on UNIX/Linux systems and as
a client for Microsoft Windows systems.

Samba uses the SMB/CIFS protocols to allow communication between client
and server. The SMB protocol contains many commands and is commonly used
to control network devices and systems from a remote location. A
vulnerability exists in the way the smb daemon processes commands sent by
a client system when accessing resources on the remote server.The problem
exists in the allocation of memory which can be exploited by an attacker
to cause an integer overflow, possibly leading to the execution of
arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of the user
running the smbd process.

--
Affected Systems:
	Samba 3.0.8 and prior

--
Attack Scenarios: 
An attacker needs to supply specially crafted data to the smb daemon to
overflow a buffer containing the information for the access control lists
to be applied to files in the smb query.

-- 
Ease of Attack: 
Difficult.

-- 
False Positives:
None Known

--
False Negatives:
None Known

-- 
Corrective Action: 
Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patch
