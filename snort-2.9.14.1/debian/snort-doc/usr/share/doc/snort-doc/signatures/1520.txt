Rule:  

--
Sid:
1520

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to access server-info.
Using the Apache webserver, this url is generally handled by the
mod_info module, which will happily disclose valuable information about
your webserver which may aid in their attack.

--
Impact:
Information disclosure.

--
Detailed Information:
The mod_info module "provides a comprehensive overview of the server
configuration including all installed modules and directives in the
configuration files" for the Apache webserver.  Successfully accessing the url
that is handle by mod_info may give an attacker valuable information about
the server.

If mod_info is in use and the attacking host is allowed to access it,
every possible configuration option that the Apache server is using can
be viewed. This includes ACLs, modules, file and directory names, and
other valuable information that will help an attacker determine ways of
attacking the server.

--
Affected Systems:
	Apache webservers with mod_info enabled.
 
--
Attack Scenarios:
As part of an attack against an Apache webserver, an attacker may try to
access "/server-info" which is typically handled by the mod_info module.  If
sucessful, this will give valuable information about the webserver for
use in further attacks. 

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. No exploit software is required.

--
False Positives:
Few, but certainly possible.  Since this rule only checks for the
existance of "/server-info" in the url, any url containing that string will
trigger this rule.  A few common false positives may include urls like:

http://victim/server-info/contact.html
http://victim/really/long/directory/server-info.html

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:
Determine if server-info exists on the victim in question, and if the attacker
is allowed to access it.

If mod_info is necessary on this server, consider restricting access to
it via Apache directives, i.e.:

<Location /server-info>
    SetHandler server-info
    Order deny,allow
    Deny from all
    Allow from .yourdomain.net
</Location>
