--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a format
string vulnerability associated with the Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
rpc.statd.

--
Impact:
Remote root access. This may permit execution of arbitrary commands with
the privileges of root.

--
Detailed Information:
The rpc.statd daemon is a component of Network File System (NFS) that
implements the Network Status and Monitor (NSM) RPC functions.  NSM
monitors the status of NFS clients and servers and maintains a list of
hosts that have registered to be notified when an NFS host crashes. 
There is a format string vulnerability associated with the code that
implements the monitoring of a given host, possibly permitting the
execution of arbitrary commands with the privileges of root. 

--
Affected Systems:
	Conectiva Linux 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 5.0, 5.1
	Debian Linux 2.2, 2.3
	Red Hat Linux 6.0, 6.1, 6.2
	SuSE Linux 6.3, 6.4, 7.0
	Trustix Secure Linux 1.0, 1.1

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can attempt to exploit the format string error allowing
execution of arbitrary commands with the privileges of root.  

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploit code is freely available. 

--
False Positives:
None Known.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

--
Corrective Action:
Limit remote access to RPC services.

Filter RPC ports at the firewall to ensure access is denied to
RPC-enabled machines.

Disable unneeded RPC services.
