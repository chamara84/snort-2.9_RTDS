Summary:
input handling error in BitKeeper.

--
Impact:
Arbitrary code execution

--
Detailed Information:
BitKeeper is a cross platform commercial application for managing 
software development.

When used in daemon mode, BitKeeper opens a listening service that can 
be accessed via an ordinary http request. The input from this request is
not correctly processed and allows execution of arbitrary code.

A proof of concept exploit is available for this vulnerability.

--
Affected Systems:
All versions of BitKeeper up to and including version 3.0 running in 
daemon mode.

--
Attack Scenarios:
The attacker can send a specially crafted URI to the listening service 
that contains code the attacker wishes to execute.

Proof of concept URI by Maurycy Prodeus:
http://www.example.com:port/diffs/foo.c@%27;echo%20%3Eiwashere%27?nav=index.html|src/|hist/foo.c

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple

--
False Positives:
None Known

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to version 3.0.1.

Do not run BitKeeper in daemon mode.

Disallow all access to the BitKeeper server via http.
