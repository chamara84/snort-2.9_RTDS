Corrective Action:

This is a particularly difficult Trojan to remove and should only be 
attempted by an experienced Windows Administrator.

Edit the system registry to remove the extra keys or restore a 
previously known good copy of the registry.

Affected registry keys are:

	HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\exefile\shell\open\command
	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Current Version\Run
	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Current Version\RunServices
	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Hardware\Data
	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Hardware\Enum
	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\DirectXMedia

Registry keys added are:

	HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.dl

Removal of the replicant is also required, look for files ending in 
".exe" or ".dll" in the <drive>:\Windows\ or <drive>:\Windows\System\ 
folders that use alphanumeric file names. The name of the replicant may 
be in one of the registry keys above.

A machine reboot is required to clear the existing process from running 
in memory.
