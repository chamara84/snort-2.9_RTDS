Detailed Information:
This may be an attacker probing for vulnerable versions of rpc services.
In this case, the rpc service xfsmd.

It is possible for an attacker to supply a meta character followed by
any commands or code of his choosing to the xfsmd daemon.

Due to a programming error, the service does not correctly check for the
characters and they are not stripped from the request.

The xfsmd daemon is not installed by default on IRIX systems but it is 
part of an optional package.
