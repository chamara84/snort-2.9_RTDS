Rule:

--
Sid:
100000179

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known 
vulnerability in a web server using the TRACE command. In this case, the attack 
is aimed at the Solaris Management Console Java Web Interface.

--
Impact:
Possible disclosure of information.

--
Detailed Information:
The TRACE method is used when debugging a webserver to ensure that server 
returns information to the client correctly. When used with other 
vulnerabilities it is possible to use the TRACE method to return sensitive 
information from a webserver such as authentication data and cookies.

This is known as a Cross Site Tracing (XST) attack.

Note: Users who are using sid 2056 with the HTTP_PORTS variable set to 898 do 
not need to use this rule.

--
Affected Systems:
All platforms running a webserver that responds to the TRACE method.

--
Attack Scenarios:
The attacker needs to perform a TRACE request to a vulnerable server.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple

--
False Positives:
The TRACE method is legitimate and may be used to debug a webserver or can be 
used to debug other networking equipment.

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:
Disable the webserver from responding to TRACE requests.
