Sid:
2223

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to access csNews.cgi on an internal web server. This may indicate an attempt to exploit a file disclosure vulnerability in csNews.cgi, a script distributed by CGIScript.NET.

--
Impact:
Information disclosure. The attacker must have an authenticated account to successfully execute this exploit.

--
Detailed Information:
csNews.cgi is a Perl script that manages web-based news items, and contains a vulnerability in its ability to decode and filter out double-decoded URL data on the Advanced Settings page. An authenticated attacker can insert double-decoded directory traversals and file names into the header or footer parameters in csNews.cgi, and the files will appear in the header or footer of the page. 

--
Affected Systems:
Systems running CGISCRIPT.NET csNews 1.0 or CGISCRIPT.NET csNews Professional 1.0

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker crafts a URL with /../../passwd double-encoded in the header or footer parameter. If the password file exists in that location, the file will appear in the header or footer of the web page.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploits exist.

--
False Positives:
If a legitimate remote user accesses csNews.cgi, this rule may generate an event.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
It is not known if this vulnerability has been patched or fixed in later versions. Contact the vendor for more information.
