Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to access the php 
application Phorum using a default administrator account.

--
Impact:
Severe - Phorum administration is controlled by the attacker

--
Detailed Information:
Phorum is a popular PHP forum and versions 3.0.7 and previous are 
vulnerable to this exploit.  An attacker can exploit a bug in Phorum's 
auth.php script to gain administration access using a universal password
(boogieman) supplied with the variable PHP_AUTH_USER. Phorum's PHP 
scripts rely on auth.php to authenticate the user.

--
Attack Scenarios:
The attacker requests /admin.php?PHP_AUTH_USER=boogieman from the Phorum
PHP scripts. It is now possible to use the administration script to 
modify all Phorum settings.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple

--
False Positives:
None known
