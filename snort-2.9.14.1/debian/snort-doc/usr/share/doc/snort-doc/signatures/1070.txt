Sid:
1070

Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to initiate a WebDAV SEARCH 
on a web server.

--
Impact:
Information gathering. Potential Denial of Service (DoS).

--
Detailed Information:
IIS 5.0 includes an implementation of WebDAV for purposes of web publishing.
As shipped, it contains two vulnerabilities that can allow an attacker
to get a complete directory listing from the web root and to DoS the
web server.

If the target is IIS 5.0, then an attacker may have gotten a complete
directory listing from within the web root, which can be useful information
for attackers (could be a prelude to a more serious attack).  IIS 5.0's
WebDAV implementation is also vulnerable to a Denial of Service vulnerability
if the search string is too long.

--
Affected Systems:
	IIS 5.0
	Any web server running WebDAV, though no exploits are known for servers 
	other than IIS 5.0.

--
Attack Scenarios:
Attacker gets a listing by sending something like:
SEARCH / HTTP/1.1
Attacker DoSes the web server using pre-existing tools.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None Known.

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:
Check the host for signs of compromise.

Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.

Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches.

Disallow WebDAV access to the server from resources external to the
protected network.
