Rule:  

--
Sid:
1791

--
Summary:
This event indicates that a backdoor may be installed on a machine.

--
Impact:
One of the systems may have been compromised.

--
Detailed Information:
www.monkey.org, the system that hosts fragroute was compromised and the fragroute
source code was modified to contain a back door.  The code was corrupted on 
May 17, 2002.  Versions after May 31, 2002  and before May 17, 2002 do not contain the backdoor.

--
Affected Systems:

Systems running
	dsniff 2.3
	fragroute 1.2
	fragrouter 1.6

--
Attack Scenarios:
The backdoor contacts the IP address 216.80.99.202.  A person connecting from that
address can use the backdoor to acquire full control over the compromised machine.  

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
While the IP address flagged in this rule was associated with the backdoor at the time
fragroute was trojaned, it may now or in the future be used by unrelated parties.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to a new version of fragroute and sanitize the trojaned machine.
