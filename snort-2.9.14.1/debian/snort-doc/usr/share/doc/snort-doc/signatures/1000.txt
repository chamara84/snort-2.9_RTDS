Impact:
Information gathering.  This attack can disclose the directory structure on a vulnerable Internet Information Server(IIS).

Because of changes to the authentication methods between versions 3.0 and 4.0, these scripts can be accessed directly, and without authentication. An attacker can access one of these scripts, bdir.htr, to disclose the
vulnerable server's directory structure.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can craft a URL to access the bdir.htr file, which can disclose the directory structures on the vulnerable server.

--
False Positives:
