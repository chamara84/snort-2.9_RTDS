Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to access the Unify eWave 
ServletExec uploader servlet, which may lead to a web server compromise.

--
Impact:
Serious. Execution of arbitrary code is possible.

--
Detailed Information:
Unify eWave ServletExec is a webserver-based JSP and Java Servlet
environment available for many popular web servers (e.g., Apache, Netscape
web server, and IIS).  Versions of ServletExec before 3.0E contain a
vulnerability in UploadServlet that could allow an attacker to upload
arbitrary files, including executables used to compromise the web server.

--
Affected Systems:
Unify eWave ServletExec versions before 3.0E. 

--
Attack Scenarios:
Attacker sends a simple HTTP GET or POST like the following:
GET http://target/servlet/com.unify.ewave.servletexec.UploadServlet HTTP/1.0

The attacker could upload any arbitrary file onto the web server, including
executable code that can then be used to compromise the web server.

--
Ease of Attack:
Relatively simple handcrafted HTTP GET or POST.

--
False Positives:
It is possible that legitimate web administrators could use UploadServlet.

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:
Examine the packet to see if a web request was being done.  Try to
determine if the request was by a legitimate web admin or not.
Determine from the web server's configuration whether it was a threat or not
(e.g., whether the web server even runs ServletExec, and if so whether
it was running a vulnerable version).
