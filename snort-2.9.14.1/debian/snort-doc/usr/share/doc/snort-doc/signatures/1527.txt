Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known 
vulnerability in the Basilix webmail PHP script.

An attacker can access mysql.class file to obtain MySQL login and use it
for further attacks.

--
Impact:
Serious. Password disclosure which can lead to further system 
compromise.

authenticate directly to a mysql database. Many Sun Cobalt Linux servers use Basilix webmail

--
Detailed Information:
A webserver usually sends files in the webroot to an anonymous user 
without further processing. PHP scripts often include files (which 
contain configuration variables, functions, etc.) that are stored 
using a suffix that does not prevent a webserver sending them in clear 
text. The ".class" suffix is not usually explicitly denied in a standard
web server configuration and the file "mysql.class" may be sent to the 
attacker.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker gets mysql.class containing database login credentials. The attacker can then connect to the database server using the login provided by mysql.class file and modify the database.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple

--
False Positives:
File doesn't exist or mysql.class is for example a java class file publicly available on the server

--
False Negatives:
None known

--
Corrective Action:
Update Basilix script (www.basilix.org)

Check files which contain php code for a suffix that might be rendered in plaintext by the web server.

Workaround - register .class the same way that the extensions .php, .php3 or.php4 are registered in the web server configuration file.
Note: .class is usually used by java applets
