--
Summary:
This event is generated when a remote attacker sends an IMAP FIND
command with a malformed argument to an internal IMAP server. This may
indicate an attempt to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in the
IMAP FIND command.

--
Impact:
Possible shell access on the IMAP server, leading to arbitrary code
execution. The attacker must have a valid IMAP account on the mail
server to attempt this exploit.

--
Detailed Information:
When a FIND command with a malformed and overly long argument is sent to
a vulnerable IMAP server, a buffer overflow condition may occur. This
can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code from the command shell.
Note that this exploit can only be attempted by a user with a valid IMAP
account.

--
Affected Systems:
	University of Washington imapd versions 10.234 or 12.264.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker with an IMAP account on the server can send a malformed and
sufficiently long FIND command to the IMAP server, creating a buffer
overflow condition. This can then allow the attacker to execute
arbitrary shell code on the compromised server.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploits exist, but the user must have a valid IMAP account on
the server.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Apply the patch for your current version of imapd appropriate to your
operating system.
