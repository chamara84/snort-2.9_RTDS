Summary:
A denial of service attack known as Land has been launched. Some TCP/IP 
stacks crash or hang when sent a spoofed TCP SYN packet with the same 
source and destination host and the same source and destination port.  

--
Impact:
Denial of service against a target host.

--
Detailed Information:
The Land denial of service attack attempts to crash or disable a target 
host by sending a spoofed TCP SYN packet with an identical source and 
destination IP and identical source and destination port.  Some target 
hosts will crash others will be temporarily disabled.

Affected Systems:
	Windows 95
	Windows NT Any unpatched version 
	SCO CMW+ 3.0
	SCO Open Desktop/Open Server 3.0
	SCO Open Server 5.0
	SCO UnixWare 2.1.0
	Gauntlet 3.2/HP-UX 10.10 and Gauntlet 4.1/HP-UX 10.20

--
Attack Scenarios:
A malicious user crafts a packet to cause a Denial of Service against a 
target host.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple to craft such a packet using any number of packet crafting tools 
such as nmap and hping.


--
False Positives:
None known.  This should have a very low likelihood of false positives.

--
False Negatives:
The exploit code has an IP identification number and TCP sequence number
of 3868.  If a user changes the source code to have a different IP 
identification or TCP sequence number, the rule will not fire. 

--
Corrective Action:
Malicious outside attacks can be prevented by configuring your 
packet-filtering device to block packets from entering your network that
have source IP's from your network address space.
