--
Summary:
This event is generated when a remote user uses invalid data within an
IMAP CREATE command sent to port 143 on an internal server. This may
indicate an attempt to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in the
IMAP CREATE command in the Alt-N MDaemon IMAP server. This vulnerability
may affect other IMAP implementations.

--
Impact:
Remote execution of arbitrary code, which could allow an attacker to
interfere with or crash mail services. The attacker must have a valid
IMAP account and be authenticated by the mail server to attempt this exploit.

--
Detailed Information:
Some versions of the Alt-N MDaemon IMAP server contain a vulnerability
where, if an authenticated user creates a folder with a sufficiently
long name, arbitrary code can be executed with system privileges. Note
that this exploit can only be attempted by an authenticated user with a
valid IMAP account on the mail server.

--
Affected Systems:
	Alt-N MDaemon 6.7.5 or Alt-N MDaemon 6.7.9 IMAP servers.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An authenticated user can create a new folder with a sufficiently long
name, creating a buffer overflow condition. The attacker can then
execute arbitrary code with system privileges, which may allow the
attacker to interfere with or crash mail services.

--
Ease of Attack:
Exploits exist, but the user must be authenticated before attempting the exploit.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.

Check the host for signs of compromise.
