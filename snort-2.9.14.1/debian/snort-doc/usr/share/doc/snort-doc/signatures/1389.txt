Sid:
1389

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to access the
script viewcode.jse.

--
Impact:
Information disclosure. An attacker may have been able to read the
contents of any file on the web server.

--
Detailed Information:
Nombas ScriptEase WebServer Edition is a Javascript environment for web
servers.  As shipped, it comes with a sample script called "viewcode.jse"
that contains a vulnerability.  This vulnerability allows an attacker
to view any file on the web server.  The web server that ships with
Novell Netware 5.1 before SP3 contains this vulnerability.

--
Affected Systems:
	Netware 5.1 and Nombas ScriptEase WebServer Edition
 
--
Attack Scenarios:
Attacker sends a simple URL like the following:
http://target/lcgi/sewse.nlm?sys:/novonyx/suitespot/docs/sewse/viewcode.jse+httplist+httplist/../../../../../system/somefile

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple handcrafted URL.

--
False Positives:
None Known

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:
Examine the packet to see if a malicious web request was being done.
Try to determine what the requested file was, and determine
from the web server's configuration whether it was a threat or not
(e.g., whether the requested file even existed and whether the web
server contained the viewcode.jse sample script).  The existence of
sample scripts on a web server may indicate larger vulnerabilities.
