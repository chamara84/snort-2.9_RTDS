Summary: 
This event is generated when an attempt is made to access the host
filestem via fingerd.

-- 
Impact: 
Information gathering.

--
Detailed Information:
This event is generated when a specific attack against a vulnerable
version of the finger daemon is detected. 

The Finger daemon is used to provide information about users on a UNIX
system. A certain version of fingerd shipped with one release of FreeBSD
4.1.1 contained an added feature that allows a remote user to request
some files via the use of finger. This event indicates that such a
request has been made.

The feature also allowed any file or directory structure on the host
readable by the "nobody" user to also be accessed, leading to
unauthorized information disclosure.

--
Affected Systems:
	FreeBSD 4.1.1 Release

--
Attack Scenarios:  
An attacker can use finger to read a directory structure or file by
making a request via finger.

-- 
Ease of Attack: 
Simple, no exploit software is required, just a specially formatted
finger query.

-- 
False Positives: 
None Known

--
False Negatives: 
None Known

-- 
Corrective Action: 
Disable the finger daemon or limit the addresses that can access the
service via a firewall or TCP wrappers.
