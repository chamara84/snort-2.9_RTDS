Sid:
3067

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a buffer
overflow associated with the several commands of an IMAP service. This
event is concerned with data supplied as a parameter to the
"examine" command.

--
Impact:
A successful attack may cause a denial of service or a buffer overflow
and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code on a vulnerable server.

--
Detailed Information:
This event is generated when excess data is detected in an IMAP command.
Some IMAP implementations exhibit programming errors that can lead to a
buffer overflow condition when excess data is supplied to a static
buffer.

A vulnerability exists in the way that the Mercury Mail IMAP service
handles several commands.  An excessively long command argument can
trigger a denial of service or a buffer overflow and the subsequent
execution of arbitrary code on a vulnerable server.

In the case of Ipswitch IMail, an overly long mailbox name supplied as a
parameter to the examine command may be a trigger condition of a buffer
overflow. A name of 259 bytes or more may cause this to occur.
