--
Summary:
This event is generated when activity relating to spurious ftp traffic 
is detected on the network.

--
Impact:
Varies from information gathering to a serious compromise of an ftp 
server.

--
Detailed Information:
FTP is used to transfer files between hosts. This event is indicative of
spurious activity in FTP traffic between hosts.

The event may be the result of a transfer of a known protected file or 
it could be an attempt to compromise the FTP server by overflowing a 
buffer in the FTP daemon or service.

In this case, the rule will generate an event due to the attempted
transfer of a shadow file. This file is generally used on muli-user
systems to provide greater security for user passwords. This file should
only be readable by the super user.

--
Attack Scenarios:
A user may transfer sensitive company information to an external party 
using FTP. Retrieval of the shadow file may allow a user to crack the
encryption scheme used and gain unauthorized access to the host.

An attacker might utilize a vulnerability in an FTP daemon to gain 
access to a host, then upload a Trojan Horse program to gain control of 
that host.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None Known

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:
Disallow access to FTP resources from hosts external to the protected 
network.

Use secure shell (ssh) to transfer files as a replacement for FTP.
