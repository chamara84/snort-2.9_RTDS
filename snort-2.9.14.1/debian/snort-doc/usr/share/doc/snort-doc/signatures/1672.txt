Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a buffer overflow associated with certain versions of the Sun Solaris FTP server.  

--
Impact:
Reconnaissance.  An attacker may be able to examine records from the password shadow file.

--
Detailed Information:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability associated with a globbing function in Sun Solaris FTP servers.  An attacker may exploit this vulnerability by logging into the FTP server with a valid username and an invalid password then supplying the command "CWD ~".  This may produce a core dump in the root directory with world-readable permissions that could be examined to discover valid FTP users for the server.
