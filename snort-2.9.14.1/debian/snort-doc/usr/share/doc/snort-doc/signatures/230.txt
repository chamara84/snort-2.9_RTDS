Rule:
--
Sid:
230

--
Summary:
This event is generated when a DDoS Shaft client communicates with a Shaft handler.  It is also possible that this event may be generated when any host attempts to discover or detect a Shaft handler.

--
Impact:
Attempted DDoS. If the listed source IP is in your network, it may be a Shaft client or a host attempting to discover Shaft handlers.  If the listed destination IP is in your network, it may be a Shaft handler.

--
Detailed Information:
The Shaft DDoS uses a tiered structure of compromised hosts to coordinate and participate in a distributed denial of service attack. At the highest level, clients communicate with handlers to direct them to launch attacks.  A client may communicate with a handler via TCP destination port 20432.

--
Affected Systems:
Any Shaft compromised host.

--
Attack Scenarios:
A Shaft client needs to communicate with handlers to direct attacks.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Shaft code is freely available.

--
False Positives:
A legitimate server port of 20432 will cause this rule to fire.  It may also create a false positive if port 20432 is selected as an FTP data port.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

--
Corrective Action:
Perform proper forensic analysis on the suspected compromised host to discover the means of compromise.

Rebuild a confirmed compromised host.

Use a packet-filtering firewall to block inappropriate traffic to the network to prevent hosts from being compromised.
