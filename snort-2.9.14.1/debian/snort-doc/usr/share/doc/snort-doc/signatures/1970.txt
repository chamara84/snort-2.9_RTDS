Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a buffer overflow in the Remote Data Services (RDS) component of Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC).  

--
Impact:
Remote Access.  If the exploit is successful, an attacker can gain remote access to the host.

--
Detailed Information:
MDAC is a set of components that facilitates database access on Windows platforms.  The RDS component provides remote access to a database through Internet Information Services (IIS).  A vulnerability exists because of incorrect string handling with the RDS interface allowing an attacker to send a malformed HTTP request that overruns onto the heap.  This may allow execution of arbitrary code on the system. 

--
Affected Systems:
Windows hosts running MDAC 2.1, 2.5, 2.6

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can send a malformed HTTP request that is improperly validated by RDS, subsequently causing a buffer overflow.

--
Ease of Attack:
Difficult.  According to the Microsoft bulletin, a heap is more difficult to exploit than a stack overflow.

--
False Positives:
None Known.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

--
Corrective Action:
Apply security hotfix for Q329414.
