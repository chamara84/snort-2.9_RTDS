Sid:
1377

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a file
globbing vulnerability associated with WU-FTPD.

--
Impact:
Serious. Remote root access. A successful attack can allow remote
execution of commands with privileges of WU-FTPD, most often root.

--
Detailed Information:
An exploit in Washington University FTP daemon (WU-FTPD) code associated
with file globbing can allow execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of WU-FTPD, typically root. WU-FTPD invokes the glob function
when certain characters are used in a file name argument supplied by an
FTP client. The glob function fails to properly handle illegal strings
such as "~{" and "~[". The problem is compounded when the glob function
returns an error condition that is incorrectly handled, which may lead
to the corruption of process memory space. This exploit requires login
access to a vulnerable server either via an anonymous or established
user account.

--
Affected Systems:
	WU-FTPD 2.6.1, 2.6.0, and 2.5.0.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker may login to a vulnerable WU-FTP server and enter a
malformed file argument to gain access and execute arbitrary commands.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.  

--
False Positives:
None Known.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software

Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patch.

Do not enable anonymous FTP access unless required.
