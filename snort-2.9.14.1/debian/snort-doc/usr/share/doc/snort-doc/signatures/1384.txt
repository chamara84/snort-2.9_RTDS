Rule:

--
Sid:
1384

--
Summary:
This event is generated when a remote user attempts to send a NOTIFY directive to an internal host's Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) server.

--
Impact:
Attempted administrator access or denial of service.  A successful attack may cause a denial of service or permit the execution of arbitrary code with administrator privileges.

--
Detailed Information:
The UPnP is used to find network-based devices.  Specifically, UPnP NOTIFY directives are employed to advertise the existence of UPnP devices on the network.  A vulnerability exists that permits a malformed NOTIFY directive to cause a buffer overflow on the remote host listening on UPnP.  Alternately, a malformed NOTIFY directive may be used to exhaust resources on a remote host listening on UPnP.  The buffer overflow attack may permit the execution of arbitrary code on the host with administrator privileges.

--

Affected Systems:
Microsoft Windows 98, 98SE, ME, XP

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker may obtain craft a malformed NOTIFY directive to cause a denial of service or attempt to execute arbitrary code on the victim host.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploit code is freely available.

--
False Positives:
This event will be generated if external hosts are permitted to query for UPnP devices.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

--
Corrective Action:
Block inbound UPnP traffic.
