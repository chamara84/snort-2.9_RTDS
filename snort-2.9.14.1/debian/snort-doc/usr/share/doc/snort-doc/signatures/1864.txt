--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to enter the "SITE 
NEWER" command on an FTP server.

--
Impact:
Denial of Service. Possible execution of arbitrary code is possible.

--
Detailed Information:
When issued the "SITE NEWER" command, some versions of wu-ftpd can 
consume excessive ammounts of memory whichthen can effectively act as a 
denial of service to the entire system. If a user can create files on 
the system, it may be possible to execute code as the user running the 
ftpd daemon, typically root.

--
Affected Systems:
	wu-ftpd versions prior to and including 2.4.2.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker might be trying to DoS the system, and it could lead to 
arbitrary code execution with root privileges.

--
Ease of Attack:
Medium

--
False Positives:
This can lead to false positives if the ftp service is not wu-ftpd or if
wu-ftpd is greater than version 2.4.2

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade the wu-ftpd service
