Rule:

--
Sid:
2570

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known 
vulnerability on a web server or a web application resident on a web
server.

--
Impact:
Information gathering and system integrity compromise. Possible unauthorized
administrative access to the server. Possible execution of arbitrary code of 
the attackers choosing in some cases.

--
Detailed Information:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to compromise a host
running a Web server or a vulnerable application on a web server.

In particular this rule generates events when a non-standard HTTP
request is made to a server. Some applications do not handle this
exception in an acceptable manner and may present an attacker with the
opportunity to exploit the application and server becasue of this.

Some applications do not perform stringent checks when validating the
credentials of a client host connecting to the services offered on a
host server. This can lead to unauthorized access and possibly escalated
privileges to that of the administrator. Data stored on the machine can
be compromised and trust relationships between the victim server and 
other hosts can be exploited by the attacker.

--
Affected Systems:
	All systems using a web server.
	Seattle Lab Software SLMail Pro 2.0 to 2.0.9 inclusive

--
Attack Scenarios:
Many attack vectors are possible from simple directory traversal to
exploitation of buffer overflow conditions.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploits exist.

--
False Positives:
The use of some proxy servers like Inktomi, may cause this rule to
generate events.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Ensure the system is using an up to date version of the software and has
had all vendor supplied patches applied.

Check the host logfiles and application logs for signs of compromise.
