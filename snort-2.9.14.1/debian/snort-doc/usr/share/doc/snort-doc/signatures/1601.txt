Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to read a file on a host using a well known vulnerability in htdig.

--
Impact:
Severe. Unauthorized file access

--
Detailed Information:
Some versions of htdig allow inclusions to be made from configuration files as a parameter to the htsearch function. Any file can be included by enclosing it in single quotes ('foo').

Using this vulnerability, any single quoted input string (`....`) is included as an index file by htsearch. This allows an attacker to read any file on the host.

--
Affected Systems:
HTDig versions 3.1.1, 3.1.2, 3.1.3, 3.1.4 and 3.2.0b1

--
Attack Scenarios:
A input form with a textbox named "Exclude" and http post action handled by htsearch or a url similar to http://www.foo.com/cgi-bin/htsearch?Exclude=%60/anyfile%60 can be used to access files on your host. %60 is the single quote caracter "`".

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. No exploit scripts required

--
False Positives:
None known

--
False Negatives:
None known

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.
