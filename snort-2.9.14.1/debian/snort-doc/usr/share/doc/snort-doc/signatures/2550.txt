2550

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a buffer overflow 
associated with Winamp's processing of a .XM file module name.

--
Impact:
A successful attack may permit a buffer overflow that allows the execution
of arbitrary code at the privilege level of the user running Winamp.

--
Detailed Information:
Winamp is a media file player for Windows developed by Nullsoft.  A buffer
overflow exists because of insufficient bounds checking while parsing fields
in a .XM file.  An overly long module name may cause the buffer overflow 
permitting the execution of arbitrary code at the privilege level of the user 
running Winamp.

--
Affected Systems:
Winamp 2.x, 3.x, and 5.0-5.02

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can create and send a malformed .XM tracker name that may cause
a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code on the
vulnerable host.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.
