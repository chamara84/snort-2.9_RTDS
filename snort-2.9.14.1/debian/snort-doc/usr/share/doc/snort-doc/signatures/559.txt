Sid:

559

--

Summary:

A network-external client has connected to an internal GNUTella server
and issued a connect attempt to begin communications.

--

Impact:

Possible policy violation; possible excess network load.

--

Detailed Information:

GNUTella is a P2P (Peer-to-Peer) protocol for exchanging arbitrary
files.  Depending on your site's policies, using it may be a policy
violation.

If not properly configured, GNUTella clients may accidentally share out
confidential files.  GNUTella worms (which use deceptive names to
encourage download) and viruses may also be accidentally downloaded by a
client.

This rule being triggered means that a GNUTella server has been detected
on the protected network.

--

Affected Systems:

Any system with a GNUTella client installed (available for most
platforms)

--

Attack Scenarios:

False Positives:

result, any email, web page, or other network content that discusses the
protocol and its messages will trigger this alert.

--

False Negatives:

Corrective Action:
