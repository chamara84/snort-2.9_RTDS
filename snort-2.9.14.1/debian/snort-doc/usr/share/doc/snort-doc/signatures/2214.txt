Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to access mailview.cgi on an internal web server. This may indicate an attempt to exploit a directory traversal vulnerability in MailStudio 2000 2.0 and earlier.

--
Impact:
Information disclosure.

--
Detailed Information:
MailStudio 2000 is mail server software for Solaris or Linux operating systems. It contains a vulnerability where data sent to mailview.cgi is not properly parsed. This can allow an attacker to use directory traversal techniques (/../) within the "html" parameter to view arbitrary files on the system, including other users' email, configuration files, and password files.

--
Affected Systems:
Systems running MailStudio 2000 2.0 and earlier.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request to a vulnerable web server with another user's email file as the html argument. The attacker will then be able to view the file.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploits exist.

--
False Positives:
If a legitimate remote user accesses mailview.cgi, this rule may generate an event.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
It is not known if this vulnerability has been fixed. Contact the vendor, 3R Soft (http://www.3rsoft.com), for more information.
