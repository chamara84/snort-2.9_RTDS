Detailed Information:
The Transparent Internet Routing for IP Mobile Hosts IETF draft defines ICMP Type 32 Code 0 as an ICMP Mobile Host Redirect Message.  This message was intended to be used by mobile computers to inform base-stations of their location on the network as they move from base-station to base-station.  

This IETF draft was never ratified, and no hardware is known to exist that generates this type of ICMP datagram
