Detailed Information:
Insane Network 4.0 uses port 2000 as its default, but -2000, or port 63536, incarnations also exist.
Insane Network 4.0 has a number of functions. The following strings are indicative of a particular Insane Network 4.0 attack.
Be aware that some versions of Insane Network 4.0 will send their attack strings one letter at a time. For example,
to send the bomb command, some versions will send only one letter per packet, resulting in bomb being spelled out in multiple packets.

Attack Scenarios: 
The victim must first install the server. Be wary of suspicious files because they often can be backdoors in disguise.
Once the victim mistakenly installs the server program, the attacker usually will employ an IP scanner program
to find the IP addresses of victims that have installed the program. Then the attacker enters the IP address, port number (which 
is assigned to the server program by the attacker: default is 2000), and presses the connect button and he has access to your computer.

-- 

Ease of Attack: 
Easy. Simply a matter of pressing the connect button once the victim has installed the server.
