--
Summary:
This event is generated when a request is made to discover the version and configuration information associated with the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) amd.

--
Impact:
Information disclosure.  This request can allow an attacker to discover the version of amd running as well as other configuration information about the host.

--
Detailed Information:
The amd RPC service implements the automounter daemon on UNIX hosts.  The amd service automatically mounts and unmounts requested file systems.  An attacker can make a request to amd to discover its version number. A successful request will return the version number along with other valuable configuration information about the server, including the architecture.  

--
Affected Systems:
Any system running amd.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker may request the version number associated with amd.  The response may give an attacker valuable configuration information about the host.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.  Execute the command 'amq -v -T -h hostname/IP'  

--
False Positives:
None Known.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

--
Corrective Action:
Limit remote access to RPC services.

Filter RPC ports at the firewall to ensure access is denied to RPC-enabled machines. 

Disable unneeded RPC services.
