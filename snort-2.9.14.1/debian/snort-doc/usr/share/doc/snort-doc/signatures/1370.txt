Summary:
Attempted inetd configuration access via web

--
Impact:
Attempt to gain information on system processes on webserver

--
Detailed Information:
This is an attempt to gain intelligence on the processes being run on a 
webserver. The inetd configuration lists the daemons executed at boot 
time on a UNIX or Linux based system. The attacker could possibly gain 
information needed for other attacks on the host.

--
Attack Scenarios:
The attacker can make a standard HTTP request that contains 
'/etc/inetd.conf'in the URI.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple HTTP request.

--
False Positives:
None Known

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:

Webservers should not be allowed to view or execute files and binaries 
outside of it's designated web root or cgi-bin. This file may also be 
requested on a command line should the attacker gain access to the 
machine. Making the file read only by the superuser on the system will 
disallow viewing of the file by other users.
