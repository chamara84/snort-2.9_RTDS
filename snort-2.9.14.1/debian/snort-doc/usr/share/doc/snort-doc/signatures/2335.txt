Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known
vulnerability in AppleShare IP FTP Server.

--
Impact:
Denial of Service (DoS)

--
Detailed Information:
FTP is used to transfer files between hosts. This event is indicative of spurious
activity in FTP traffic between hosts.

It is possible for a user to supply data to an FTP command, in this case
RMD, and cause the service to become unavailble to other users.

--
Affected Systems:
	Apple AppleShare IP 5.0, 5.0.1, 5.0.2, 5.0.3
	Apple AppleShare IP 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.3.1

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker needs to login to the service and use the RMD command in a
specific manner to cause the DoS.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. No exploit software required.

--
False Positives:
None Known

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:
Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches.

Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.

Disallow access to FTP resources from hosts external to the protected network.

Use secure shell (ssh) to transfer files as a replacement for FTP.
