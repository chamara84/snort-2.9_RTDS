Rule:

--
Sid:
337

--
Summary:
This event is generated when a remote attacker attempts to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in the IBM AIX FTP daemon.

--
Impact:
Remote execution of arbitrary code leading to remote root compromise.

--
Detailed Information:
The IBM AIX 4.3.x FTP daemon contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. An attacker can send an overly long string in the CEL command, causing a buffer overflow condition and allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.

--
Affected Systems:
IBM AIX 4.3.x

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker sends a suspiciously large amount of data to the FTP server in the CEL command, causing a buffer overflow condition. The attacker can then execute arbitrary code to obtain root privileges.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploits exist.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Install the patch provided by IBM. See http://www-1.ibm.com/services/continuity/recover1.nsf/MSS/ERS-SVA-E01-1999.004.1/$file/sva004.txt for an advisory and information about obtaining the patch.
