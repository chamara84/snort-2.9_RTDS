Rule:

-- 
Sid:
2655

-- 
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a vulnerability
associated with an HP WebJetAdmin web server.

-- 
Impact:
A successful attack may allow the execution of arbitrary code as root on UNIX
and SYSTEM on Windows on a vulnerable server.

-- 
Detailed Information:
The HP Web JetAdmin application allows users to manage HP JetDirect-connected
printers within their intranet using a browser. The httpd core supports an
exported function called ExecuteFile. A vulnerability exists that allows the
uploading and execution of unauthorized files by posting a malicious http
request with the script /plugins/framework/script/content.hts in conjunction
with ExecuteFile function to the web server. Discovery of the vulnerability is
credited to FX of Phenoelit.

-- 
Affected Systems:
	HP Web JetAdmin 6.5.

-- 
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can create upload and execute a malicious file on a vulnerable server.

-- 
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

-- 
False Positives:
None known.

-- 
False Negatives:
The default HP Web JetAdmin port is 8000. If an administrator selects a
different port on which to run the web server, no event will be
generated. In that case, the rule should be altered to reflect the 
port on which the web server runs. 

-- 
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.
