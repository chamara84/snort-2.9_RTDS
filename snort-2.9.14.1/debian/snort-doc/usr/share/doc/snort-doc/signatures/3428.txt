Rule:

--
Sid:
3428

--
Summary:
This rule generates an event when an attempt is made to exploit a known 
vulnerability in Microsoft RPC DCOM.

--
Impact:
Execution of arbitrary code leading to full administrator access of the 
machine. Denial of Service (DoS).

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in Microsoft RPC DCOM such that execution of 
arbitrary code or a Denial of Service condition can be issued against a 
host by sending malformed data via RPC.

The Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) handles DCOM requests sent
by clients to a server using RPC. A malformed request to an RPC port 
will result in a buffer overflow condition that will present the 
attacker with the opportunity to execute arbitrary code with the 
privileges of the local system account.

--
Affected Systems:
	Windows NT 4.0
	Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition
	Windows 2000
	Windows XP
	Windows Server 2003

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker may make a request for a file with an overly long filename 
via a network share.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Expoit code exists.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches.

Block access to RPC ports 135, 139 and 445 for both TCP and UDP 
protocols from external sources using a packet filtering firewall.
