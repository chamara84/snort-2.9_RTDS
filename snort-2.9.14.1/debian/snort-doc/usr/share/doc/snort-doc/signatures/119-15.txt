Rule: 

--
Sid: 
119-15

-- 
Summary: 
This event is generated when the pre-processor http_inspect
detects network traffic that may constitute an attack.

-- 
Impact: 
Unknown. This may indicate an attempt to evade an IDS.

--
Detailed Information:
This event is generated when the http_inspect pre-processor detects a
request for a URL that is longer than a specified length. This may
indicate an attack or an attempt to evade an IDS.

Lotus Domino Server Web servers are reported prone to a Denial of
Service condition when a long request is made to the server using
unicode characters. The http_inspect pre-processor will generate this
event should a Domino server be attacked in this way.

Specifically, when a request is made to /cgi-bin/ with approximately 330
unicode characters appended to the URL, the webserver will crash and a
DoS condition will be evident.

The maximum expected length of the URL is user configured.

--
Affected Systems:
	All web servers
	Lotus Domino 6.5.1 and 6.0.3

--
Attack Scenarios: 
An attacker may supply an over-long URI in an attempt to evade an IDS or
in a possible attack against a web server.

-- 
Ease of Attack: 
Simple.

-- 
False Positives:
None Known.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

-- 

Corrective Action:
Check the target host for signs of compromise.

Apply any appropriate vendor supplied patches.

Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.
