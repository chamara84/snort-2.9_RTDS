Sid: 325

-- 

Summary: 
This is an intelligence gathering activity.

-- 

Impact: 
The attacker may obtain a list of accounts existing on the target host.

--
Detailed Information:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to use a finger command against a host with a username of "0".  A finger query against a vulnerable finger daemon may allow the attacker to obtain a list of accounts on the target system with some details for each account where present (such as time and source of the last login). 

Obtaining a list of accounts might precipitate further attacks such as password guessing, email attacks and other abuse.

--

Attack Scenarios: 
An attacker learns that the "sys" account exists on the system. He then proceeds to guess the password and is then able to gain remote access to the system.

-- 

Ease of Attack: 
Simple, no exploit software required

-- 

False Positives: 
None Known

--
False Negatives: 
None Known

-- 

Corrective Action: 
Disable the finger daemon or limit the addresses that can access the service via firewall or TCP wrappers.
