Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to access catgy.cgi on an internal web server. This may indicate an attempt to exploit a cross-site scripting vulnerability in Aktivate e-commerce software.

--
Impact:
Arbitrary code execution, possible session hijack.

--
Detailed Information:
Aktivate 1.03 is an e-commerce application for use on Linux and other UNIX-based operating systems. An attacker can craft a URL with malicious code in the "desc" command's argument that passes the commands to catgy.cgi. If a legitimate user activates the URL, malicious code may be executed on the client computer.   

--
Affected Systems:
Systems running Aktivate 1.03.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker may craft a URL that, when activated by a legitimate user, obtains the user's session cookie, thereby allowing the attacker to pose as the user for the duration of the session.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. A proof of concept exists.

--
False Positives:
If a legitimate remote user accesses catgy.cgi, this rule may generate an event.

--
False Negatives:
None known.
