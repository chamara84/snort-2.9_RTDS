Sid:
2548

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a vulnerability
associated with the web interface support for the HP JetAdmin printer.

--
Impact:
A successful attack may allow unauthorized files to be read or the injection 
of a .hts script on a vulnerable server.

--
Detailed Information:
The HP Web JetAdmin provides a web interface for the administration of the HP
Web JetAdmin printer.  A vulnerability exists that allows unauthorized
files to be read or a .hts script to be executed.  This is caused when the
/plugins/hpjdwm/script/test/setinfo.hts script is supplied a value to the
setinclude parameter that represents an unauthorized file to be read outside
the web root or represents a .hts file that will be executed with system
privileges on the vulnerable server. 

--
Affected Systems:
HP Web JetAdmin 7.2.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can execute the vulnerable script and supply a value to setinclude
indicating an unauthorized file to be read or an .hts file to be executed. 

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. 

--
False Positives:
An authorized administrator who uses the setinclude parameter with the above
script from a source IP outside of the trusted network will cause a false positive alert.

--
False Negatives:
The default HP Web JetAdmin port is 8000.  If an administrator selects a different port
on which to run the web interface, no alert will be detected.  In that case, the rule
should be altered to reflect the port on which the web interface runs.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software or apply the appropriate patch
when it becomes available.
