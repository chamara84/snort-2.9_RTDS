--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to gain access to a PC
running pcAnywhere

--
Impact:
Serious. By the very nature of pcAnywhere, without a strong administrative
password, a successful attack will allow the attacker to gain total 
control of the machine.

--
Detailed Information:
pcAnywhere is a remote control administrative software package produced 
by Symantec (http://www.symantec.com/pcanywhere/Consumer/features.html) 
it allows control of a system via network or RAS connection.

--
Affected Systems:
	Windows XP Home and Professional
	Windows 2000 Professional/Server
	Windows NT Workstation and Server 4.0
	Windows 98/Me

--
Attack Scenarios:
With a copy of pcAnywhere, and attacker can scan a network (port 22) or
war-dial a series of modems, looking for pcAnywhere signatures.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. All that is required is an install of pcAnywhere and a host
to connect to.

--
False Positives:
Since pcAnywhere uses the same port as SSH (22) a simple open port scan 
can show hosts that my not have pcAnywhere installed

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:
Make sure only servers and workstations that require remote control have
pcAnywhere installed.
Make sure that a strong password is required for any level of access, 
this ideally should be coupled with some for of alternate 
authentication, such as SecurID, modem callback or be blocked at the 
external firewall so that the remote control functionality is only 
available on the protected network.
