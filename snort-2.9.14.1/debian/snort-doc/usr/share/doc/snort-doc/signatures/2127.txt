--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to access ikonboard.cgi
on a web server. This may indicate an attempt to exploit an arbitrary 
code execution vulnerability that affects Ikonboard web-based bulletin 
board software.

--
Impact:
Arbitrary code execution.

--
Detailed Information:
This event indicates that an attempt has been made to exploit an 
arbitrary code execution vulnerability in Ikonboard web-based bulletin 
board software. An attacker can bypass user input validation by 
inserting illegal characters into the "lang" value of a user cookie, 
which then allows the attacker to pass arbitrary Perl code to the web 
server.

--
Affected Systems:
Any web server running Ikonboard bulletin board software.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can provide a crafted cookie to the web server running 
Ikonboard. The web server will then attempt to execute the arbitrary 
Perl commands embedded in the cookie.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. A proof of concept exists.

--
False Positives:
If a legitimate remote user accesses ikonboard.cgi, this rule may 
generate an event.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
An unsupported and unofficial patch is available at http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/7361/solution/.

Check the host for signs of compromise.
