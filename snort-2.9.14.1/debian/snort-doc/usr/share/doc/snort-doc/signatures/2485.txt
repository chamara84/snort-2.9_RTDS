Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a buffer overflow 
associated with Norton Internet Security 2004 AntiSpam feature.

--
Impact:
A successful attack may permit a buffer overflow that allows the
execution of arbitrary code in the context of LOCAL_SYSTEM.

--
Detailed Information:
Norton Internet Security 2004 provides desktop security for Windows hosts.
A buffer overflow exists in a module associated with the AntiSpam feature of 
Norton Internet Security. This is an ActiveX module that has been labeled
"safe for scripting" allowing it to be accessed and run via a client's
web browser on a host running a vulnerable version of Norton Internet
Security 2004. If an attacker can entice a user on a vulnerable host to
a malicious web server, it is possible to invoke the faulty ActiveX
component.  This may cause a buffer overflow and the execution of arbitrary
code in the context of LOCAL_SYSTEM.

--
Affected Systems:
Norton Internet Security 2004, Norton Internet Security Pro 2004 versions before 7.0.3.8

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can entice a user on a vulnerable host to a malicious web
page and execute the faulty ActiveX component, possibly causing
a buffer overflow and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code on the
vulnerable host.

-- Ease of Attack:
Difficult unless exploit code becomes available.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.
