Sid:
2464

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a buffer overflow
associated with the Ethereal decode of the Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol 
(EIGRP).

--
Impact:
A successful attack may allow the execution of arbitrary code as root or
LOCAL_SYSTEM privilege on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
There is a vulnerability associated with particular versions of Ethereal that
may cause a buffer overflow when a malformed EIGRP packet is decoded.  This
may permit the execution of arbitrary code with root or LOCAL_SYSTEM privilege.
The buffer overflow occurs when a larger than expected packet length value is
discovered in the EIGRP payload.

--
Affected Systems:
Any host running Ethereal versions 0.8.14 through 0.10.2.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can create and send a malformed EIGRP packet, and if decoded by
a vulnerable version of Ethereal, can cause a buffer overflow and the 
subsequent execution of arbitrary code.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploit code is available.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Update to version 0.10.3 of Ethereal.
