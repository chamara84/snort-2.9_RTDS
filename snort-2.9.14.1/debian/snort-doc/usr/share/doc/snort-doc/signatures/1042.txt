Rule:

--
Sid:
1042

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to craft a URL
containing the text 'Translate: f' in an attempt to view file source code.

--
Impact:
Intelligence gathering.  This attack may permit disclosure of the source
code of files not normally available for viewing.

--
Detailed Information:
Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 contains scripting
engines to support various advanced files types such as .ASP and .HTR
files.  This permits the execution of server-side processing.  IIS
determines which scripting engine is appropriate to use depending on the
file extension.  If an attacker crafts a URL request ending in
'Translate: f' and followed by a slash '/', IIS fails to send the file
to the appropriate scripting engine for processing.  Instead, it returns
the source code of the referenced file to the browser.

--
Affected Systems:
	Microsoft IIS 5.0

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can craft a URL to include the 'Translate: f' and followed
by a '/' to disclose source code on the vulnerable server. 

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.  Attack scripts are freely available.

--
False Positives:
Some Microsoft applications make use of the 'Translate: f' header and
may cause this rule to generate an event. These include applications that use WebDAV
for publishing content on a webserver such as Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA)

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

--
Corrective Action:
Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patch.
