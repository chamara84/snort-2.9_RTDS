Corrective Action:

Webservers should not be allowed to view or execute files and binaries outside of it's designated web root or cgi-bin. Disallowing viewing of this file via a URI is suggested. For Apache webservers add the following to httpd.conf and restart the server.

<Files ~ "^\.ht">
    Order allow,deny

</Files>
