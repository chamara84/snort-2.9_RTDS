Summary:
This event indicates an attempt to exploit the tool talk RPC database 
service
--

Impact:
Possible unauthorized administrative access to the server or application
or a denial of service to the affected application running on a Solaris 
system
--

Detailed Information:
ToolTalk RPC database service (rpc.ttdbserverd) does not perform 
adequate input validation or provide a format string specifier argument 
when writing to syslog. This means a specifically crafted RPC request to
the ToolTalk RPC database service overwriting specific locations in 
memory and therefore allowing execution of code with the same permission
level as the user running ttdbserverd, usually root.
--

Affected Systems:
	Solaris 1.1 - 2.6
Possibly other vendors, if you are running Tool Talk (rpc.ttdbserverd) check with your vendor.
--

Attack Scenarios:
An attacker will send a specially crafted RPC call to the 
rpc.ttdbserverd daemon running on an affected system. A sucessful 
attack will then run code on the server with the access level of the 
root user.
--

Ease of Attack:
Simple, Exploit code is available.
--

False Positives:
None known
--

False Negatives:
None known
--

Corrective Action:
Updates packages and patches are available from vendors, install them or
disable the service if not needed.
