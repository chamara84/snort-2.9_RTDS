Impact:
An attacker may be attempting to break into one or more web servers monitored

Detailed Information:
Hydra is a password-cracking tool released by a group of security experts 
called THC, "The Hacker's Choice." Requests sent by this tool to a web server 
contain the User-Agent string "Mozilla/4.0 (Hydra)". Since normal browsers' 
User-Agent strings do not contain the string "(Hydra)", the presence of this 
string indicates that the Hydra tool is likely being used.

Affected Systems:
Any system running a web server.

--
Attack Scenarios:
Attackers will use the Hydra password-cracking tool.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple, as the program is publicly available and is well-documented.

False Positives:
None known.

Corrective Action:
Check system logs and Snort alert logs for suspicious activity, particularly 
unusual logons. Ensure that secure passwords are being used throughout your 
network.
