Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to access
view_broadcast.cgi on a server used for streaming media services.

--
Impact:
Information gathering and system integrity compromise.

--
Detailed Information:
The view_broadcast.cgi script contains a known vulnerability that may
allow an attacker to perform a variety of cross-site scripting attacks.
This event is generated when an attempt is amde to access the script
directly from a source external to the protected network.

This event is generated when an attempt is made to gain unauthorized
access to a CGI application running ona web server. Some applications do
not perform stringent checks when validating the credentials of a client
host connecting to the services offered on a host server. This can lead
to unauthorized access and possibly escalated privileges to that of the
administrator. Data stored on the machine can be compromised and trust
relationships between the victim server and other hosts can be exploited by the attacker.

If stringent input checks are not performed by the CGI application, it
may also be possible for an attacker to execute system binaries or
malicious code of the attackers choosing.

--
Affected Systems:
	All systems running CGI applications

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can access an authentication mechanism and supply his/her
own credentials to gain access. Alternatively the attacker can exploit
weaknesses to gain access as the administrator by supplying input of
their choosing to the underlying CGI script.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. No exploit software required.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Ensure the system is using an up to date version of the software and has
had all vendor supplied patches applied.
