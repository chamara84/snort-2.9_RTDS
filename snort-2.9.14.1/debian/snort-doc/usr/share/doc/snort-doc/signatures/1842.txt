--
Summary:
This event is generated when a remote attacker sends a malformed
argument in the LOGIN command to an internal IMAP server, indicating an
attempt to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in Netscape Messaging
Server and University of Washington IMAP implementations. This may also
affect other IMAP server implementations.

--
Impact:
Remote execution of arbitrary code with the security privileges of the
IMAP process, possibly leading to remote root compromise.

--
Detailed Information:
A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the LOGIN command in
University of Washington IMAP and Netscape Messaging Server. This can
allow a remote attacker to send an LOGIN command with a malformed,
overlong argument to a vulnerable IMAP server, causing a buffer overflow
condition. The attacker can then execute arbitrary code on the server
with the security privileges of the IMAP server process.     

--
Affected Systems:
	Netscape Messaging Server 3.55 and earlier
	University of Washington imapd 10.234 and earlier.
	Ipswitch iMail 5.0

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker sends an overly long, malformed argument to an LOGIN command
to a vulnerable IMAP server, causing a buffer overflow condition. The
attacker is then able to execute arbitrary code on the server with the
security privileges of the IMAP server process.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploits exist.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Patches have been released for both UW IMAP and Netscape Messaging
Server. Apply the patch or upgrade to a Netscape Messaging Server
version higher than 3.55 or UW IMAP version higher than 10.234.
