Sid:
1256

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made access the root.exe
executable on a webserver. 

--
Impact:
This activity is indicative of a CodeRed worm infection.

--
Detailed Information:
As part of the CodeRed infection process, cmd.exe (the windows command
interpreter) gets copied to a number of locations throughout the
filesystem and named root.exe.  Following a modification to the registry,
root.exe becomes available from the web, allowing remote machines to
execute arbitrary commands.

Only affects Windows machines with a listening webserver, primarily IIS.
If root.exe does not exist, there is no impact aside from minor iritation.
If root.exe _does_ exist, full system-level access at the priveledge level
of the user running the webserver is possible.

--
Affected Systems:
	Microsoft IIS web servers.
 
--
Attack Scenarios:
Normally, access to root.exe is detected as part of an attempted infection
by another machine already infected by CodeRed.  In other situations,
root.exe may be accessed by remote machines/users in an attempt to gain
access to a system.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. This is worm activity.

--
False Positives:
None Known

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:
If root.exe exists in the filesystem of the web server, remove the
machine from the network and follow the vendor's recommend method for
cleaning and repairing the damage done by this particular worm.

Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches.

Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.
