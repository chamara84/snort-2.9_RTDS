Sid:
2330

--
Summary:
This event is generated when a remote user sends an overly long string 
to an IMAP server via the command AUTH. This may indicate an attempt to 
exploit a buffer overflow condition.

--
Impact:
Serious. Possible remote execution of arbitrary code, which may lead to
a remote root compromise.

--
Detailed Information:
When a large amount of data is sent to a vulnerable IMAP server in the 
AUTHENTICATE command, a buffer overflow condition may occur. This can 
allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code, which may allow the 
attacker to gain root access to the compromised server.

--
Affected Systems:
	IMAP servers

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can send a sufficiently long AUTHENTICATE command to the 
IMAP server, creating a buffer overflow condition. This can then allow 
the attacker to execute code of their choosing and possibly gain root 
access to the compromised server.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploits exist.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Apply the appropriate patches for your operating system.

Check the host for signs of compromise.
