Summary: 
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known
vulnerability in Microsoft License Logging Service.

-- 
Impact: 
Serious. Execution of arbitrary code leading to unauthorized
administrative access to the target host. Denial of Service (DoS) is
also possible.

--
Detailed Information:
Microsoft License Logging Service is used to manage licenses for
Microsoft server products.

A vulnerability in the service exists due to a programming error such
that an unchecked buffer may present an attacker with the opportunity to
exploit the service and run code of their choosing on an affected
system. The attacker may then cause a DoS condition in the service or
possibly gain administrative access to the target host.

The unchecked buffer exists when processing the length of messages sent
to the logging service.
