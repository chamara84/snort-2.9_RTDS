Rule:

--
Sid:
258

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an exploit that targets vulnerabilities in 
BIND 8.2 and 8.2.1 ("ADM named exploit 8.2/8.2.1") is executed against a
local DNS server.

--
Impact:
Severe. Remote code execution with the privileges of the BIND DNS daemon
(named). 

--
Detailed Information:
BIND is DNS server software shipped with a number of UNIX and 
Linux-based operating systems. Attackers can exploit multiple 
vulnerabilities in BIND versions between 8.2 and 8.2.1 to obtain remote 
shell access. This enables the attacker to execute arbitrary code from 
the command shell with the security privileges of the BIND DNS daemon 
(named). If named is running as root, the attacker automatically obtains
root privileges to the system.

--
Affected Systems:
Any operating system running BIND implementations below 8.2.2.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker executes an exploit script against a vulnerable server, 
obtaining shell access to the compromised machine. If named is running 
as root, the attacker automatically obtains root privileges on the 
server. Otherwise, the attacker can execute arbitrary code with the 
privileges of named, which can lead to remote root compromise.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. An exploit exists.

--
False Positives:
None known

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to BIND 8.2.2 or higher.
