-- 
Summary: 
This event is generated when an ICMP packet crafted to exploit a denial of 
service vulnerability in the Linux kernel is detected.

--
Impact:
A denial of service will be caused against vulnerable hosts. If an attacker 
sends a continuous stream of such packets, the host can be prevented from 
functioning properly for a prolonged period of time.

--
Detailed Information:
Linux kernel versions below 2.6.13 contain a flaw which will result in a null 
pointer dereference when processing ICMP packets that contain invalid SCTP 
data. In order to be vulnerable, a host must have SCTP enabled.

--
Affected Systems:
Any Linux system with a kernel version < 2.6.13 with SCTP enabled.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker could use a script to send malformed packets to a vulnerable host.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple, as a publicly available exploit script exists.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade Linux systems' kernel to version 2.6.13 or higher. Alternately, disable 
SCTP or use a firewall to block ICMP traffic at your network's border.
