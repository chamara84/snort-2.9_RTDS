Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a weakness in a host running Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) using the IISProtect web administration interface. 

--
Impact:
Administrator access and arbitrary command execution.

--
Detailed Information:
This event indicates that an attempt has been made to exploit a weakness in a host running the IISProtect web administration interface. A vulnerability exists that can allow an attacker to inject SQL code of his choice into the application.

The attacker may be trying to gain administrator access to the host, garner information on users of the system, retrieve sensitive information or be attempting to execute arbitrary code.

--
Affected Systems:
Any host using IIS with the IISProtect web administration interface.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker may inject SQL code of his choice. The attacker might then gain administrator access to the host or database.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploits exist.

--
False Positives:
None Known.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.

Check the IIS implementation on the host. Ensure all measures have been taken to deny access to sensitive files.

Ensure that the IIS implementation is fully patched.

Ensure that the underlying operating system is fully patched.

Employ strategies to harden the IIS implementation and operating system.

Check the host for signs of compromise.
