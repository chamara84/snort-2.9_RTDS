--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to access the file
nstelemetry.adp on a web server.

--
Impact:
Information gathering.

--
Detailed Information:
Access to nstelemetry.adp may indicate that a malicious user is trying to
exploit a well known vulnerability in AOLserver that allows the attacker to read
password protected files.

This event is generated when an attempt is made to compromise a host
running a Web server or a vulnerable application on a web server.

Many known vulnerabilities exist for each implementation and the 
attack scenarios are legion.

Some applications do not perform stringent checks when validating the
credentials of a client host connecting to the services offered on a
host server. This can lead to unauthorized access and possibly escalated
privileges to that of the administrator. Data stored on the machine can
be compromised and trust relationships between the victim server and 
other hosts can be exploited by the attacker.

--
Affected Systems:
	AOLServer.

--
Attack Scenarios:
Many attack vectors are possible from simple directory traversal to
exploitation of buffer overflow conditions.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploits exist.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Ensure the system is using an up to date version of the software and has
had all vendor supplied patches applied.

Check the host logfiles and application logs for signs of compromise.
