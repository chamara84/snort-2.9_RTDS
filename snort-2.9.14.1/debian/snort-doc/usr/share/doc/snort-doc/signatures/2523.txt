--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known
vulnerability in the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) used in Border
Gateway Protocol (BGP).

--
Impact:
Denial of Service (DoS).

--
Detailed Information:
The Border Gateway Protocol uses TCP to maintain sessions when handling
DNS queries. A vulnerability in the core implementation of TCP may make
it possible for an attacker to reset a number of connections and cause a
Denial of Service (DoS) to occur.

The attack is possible because the listening service will accept a TCP
sequence number within a range of what is expected in an established
session. Since BGP relies on an established TCP session state, guessing
a suitable sequence number to reset connections is feasible.

--
Affected Systems:
	Various implementations of TCP by multiple vendors

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attcker needs to send a specially crafted packet to reset a
connection.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploits are available.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches
