Sid:
1253

--
Summary:
This event is generated after a sucessful exploit of the BSD derived Telnet daemon.

--
Impact:
Remote root access.  This may or may not indicate a successful root 
compromise of a telnet server.

--
Detailed Information:
This event is generated after a possible sucessful attempt to compromise
a server running a BSD derived version of Telnet. A buffer overflow
condition exists that may present an attacker with the opportunity to
execute code of their choosing.

The attacker does not need to login to the server to exploit this
vulnerability, only a connection to the server is needed.

--
Affected Systems:
	Multiple Vendor Telnet servers running versions of telnetd derived
	from the BSD telnet daemon.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker may utilize one of the available exploit scripts.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploit scripts are publicly available. This vulnerability may
also be exploited by a worm.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Consider using Secure Shell instead of telnet.

Block inbound telnet access if it is not required.
