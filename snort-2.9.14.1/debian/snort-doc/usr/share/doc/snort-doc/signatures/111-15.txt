Summary: 
This event is generated when the pre-processor stream4
detects network traffic that may constitute an attack.

-- 
Impact:

--
Detailed Information:
This event is generated whent the pre-processor stream4 detects abnormal
Time To Live (TTL) values in a datastream. This may indicate an attempt
to evade an IDS.

--
Affected Systems:
	All systems

--
Attack Scenarios: 
An attacker can set the TTL values of all packets to a value so small
that only the IDS will see the packet and it will not get to the target
system.

-- 
Ease of Attack: 
Simple. Tools such as fragroute enable an attacker to do this.

-- 
False Positives:
