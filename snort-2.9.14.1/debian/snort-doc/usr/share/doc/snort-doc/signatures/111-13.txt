Summary: 
This event is generated when the pre-processor stream4
detects network traffic that may constitute an attack.

-- 
Impact: 
This may indicate scanning activity.

--
Detailed Information:
The pre-processor stream4 has detected network traffic that may indicate
a stealth scan is in progress. That is, packets with both the SYN and FIN
flags set have been detected. This is not normal behavior in TCP
connections.

--
Affected Systems:
	All systems

Attack Scenarios: 
An attacker may utilize scanning techniques to determine possible points
of exploitation against a host.

-- 
Ease of Attack: 
Simple. Many scanning tools exist.

-- 
False Positives:
