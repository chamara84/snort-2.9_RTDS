1133

--
Summary:
This event is generated when the Cybercop vulnerability scanner is used 
against a host.

--
Impact:
Cybercop can be used to identify vulnerabilities on host systems.

--
Detailed Information:

This particular packet is a part of Cybercop's OS identification.  
Specially crafted packets are able to elicit different responses from 
different operating systems.  This packet is likely to be part of a full
Cybercop scan rather than an isolated event. 

--
Affected Systems:

All

--
Attack Scenarios:
Cybercop can be used by attackers to determine vulnerabilities present 
on a host or network of hosts that could be used as attack vectors.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple

--
False Positives:
This tool can be used legitimately by system and network administrators.
Other vulnerability scanners may display the same behavior.

--
False Negatives:

None known.
--
Corrective Action:
TCP packets with SYN, FIN and PUSH set at the same time are abnormal, 
use a packet filtering firewall to block them.
