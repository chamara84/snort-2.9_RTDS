Summary:
vulnerability in xdrmem_getbytes used by XDR in RPC portmap services.

--
Impact:
System compromise, denial of service, execution of arbitrary code, 
information disclosure.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in various implementations of external data 
representation (XDR) libraries. An integer overflow in a component 
(xdrmem_getbytes) used by XDR can lead to a buffer overflow.

The XDR libraries are widely used by multiple vendors to provide a 
framework for data transmission across networks. This is most commonly 
used in RPC implementations.

A specially crafted rpc request can lead to remote system compromise and
super user access to the target host. Additionally, a denial of service 
and execution of arbitrary code with the privilege of the super user is 
also possible.

--
Affected Systems:
Multiple vendors including all those using:
	Sun Microsystems Network Services Library (libnsl)
	GNU C library with sunrpc (glibc)
	BSD-derived libraries with XDR/RPC routines (libc)

--
Attack Scenarios:
The attacker needs to send a specially crafted rpc request to the target
host.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple

--
False Positives:
None Known

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:
Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches.

Upgrade the vendor libraries to the latest non-affected versions. Any 
statically linked binaries and applications must be recompiled and 
restarted after the upgrade.

Disallow all RPC requests from external sources and use a firewall to 
block access to RPC ports from outside the LAN.
