2563

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a vulnerability
associated with the Symantec Firewall.

--
Impact:
A successful attack may cause a heap overflow, permitting the execution
of arbitrary code on the vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
There is a vulnerability in the way the Symantec Firewall handles NetBIOS
Name Service response packets.  If an attacker crafts a malicious UDP NetBIOS
Name Service unsolicited response to a vulnerable Symantec Firewall that does
not block port 137, it is possible to cause a heap overflow and execute
abitrary code with kernel privileges.  The vulnerability exists because of
improper validation of the existence of required fields for the NetBIOS name
returned.  The default configuration does not allow UDP port 137 traffic and
should not be exploitable if UDP port 137 is blocked.
