Rule:

--

Sid:
478

--

Summary:
This event is generated when Broadscan Smurf Scanner generates an ICMP echo
request message.

--

Impact:
ICMP echo requests are used to determine if a host is running at a
specific IP address.  A remote attacker can scan a large range of hosts
using ICMP echo requests to determine what hosts are operational on the
network.

--

Detailed Information:
The Broadscan Smurf Scanner generates an ICMP echo packet with a specific
datagram signature.  

--

Attack Scenarios:
A remote attacker might scan a large range of hosts using ICMP echo
requests to determine what hosts are operational on the network.

--

Ease of Attack:
Simple.  Packet generation tools can generate this type of ICMP packet

--

False Positives:
None known

--

False Negatives:
Packet generation tools can generate ICMP echo requests with
user-defined payloads.  This could allow attackers to replace this
signature with binary values and conceal their operating system.

--

Corrective Action:
To prevent information gathering, use a firewall to block incoming ICMP
Type 8 Code 0 traffic.
