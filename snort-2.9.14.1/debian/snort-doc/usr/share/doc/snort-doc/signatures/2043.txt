--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known
vulnerability in the Internet Security Association and Key Management 
Protocol (ISAKMP).


--
Impact:
Unknown.

--
Detailed Information:
ISAKMP is a framework for authentication using cryptographic keys. It 
specifically defines the process of key exchange as opposed to the 
generation of a cryptographic key.

ISAKMP also details the procedures for the required security 
associations in network security services.

This event indicates that a key exchange using ISAKMP failed.

--
Affected Systems:
All systems using cryptographic key exchange as an authentication 
method.

--
Attack Scenarios:
The attacker may have a store of keys associated with valid users and 
may attempt to authenticate using a combination of username and key.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple

--
False Positives:
A user may mistype a username or may be trying to authenticate using an 
expired key.

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:
Ensure that key exchanges are only allowed between trusted hosts.

Check log files for disallowed login attempts.
