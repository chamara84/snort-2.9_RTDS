Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to request an HTTP-based password change.

--
Impact:
Information gathering/remote access.  Error messages from failed password changes can indicate whether a given account exists on the server.  Successful password changes can allow remote access to the server.

Detailed Information:
Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) Version 4 supplies a feature to allow users to make remote password changes.  The iisadmpwd directory has several .HTR files that are used to implement the password changes.  An attacker can request a change and use a returned form to supply an account name, existing password, and new password either to brute force changes or discover whether a specific account name exist. 

--
Affected Systems:

Microsoft IIS 4.0

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can request password changes to discover existing accounts or brute force password changes.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None Known.

--
False Negatives:

--
Corrective Action:
Remove the IISADMPWD virtual directory to disable remote password changes.

Consider running the IIS Lockdown Tool to disable HTR functionality.
