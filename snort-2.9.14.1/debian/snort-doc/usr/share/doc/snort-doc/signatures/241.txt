Sid:
241

--
Summary:
This event is generated when a DDoS Shaft handler agent launchs a SYN flood against a target. 

--
Impact:
Attempted DDoS. If the listed source IP is in your network, it may be a Shaft agent.  If the listed destination IP is in your network, your host may be a target of a DDoS SYN flood. 

--
Detailed Information:
The Shaft DDoS uses a tiered structure of compromised hosts to coordinate and participate in a distributed denial of service attack. Agents are hosts that are directed to launch attacks.  One type of attack that may be launched is a SYN flood of a target.  The SYN packets have a telltale initial sequence number of 674711609. 

--
Affected Systems:
Any Shaft compromised host.

--
Attack Scenarios:
A Shaft agent may attack a target using a SYN flood. 

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Shaft code is freely available.

--
False Positives:
It is possible that an innocuous SYN packet will have a sequence number of 674711609.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

--
Corrective Action:
Perform proper forensic analysis on the suspected compromised host to discover the means of compromise.

Rebuild a confirmed compromised host.

Use a packet-filtering firewall to block inappropriate traffic to the network to prevent hosts from being compromised.
