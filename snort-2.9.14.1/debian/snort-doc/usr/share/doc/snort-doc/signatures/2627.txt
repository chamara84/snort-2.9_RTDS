--
Sid:
2627

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known
vulnerability in a Oracle database implementation.

--
Impact:
Serious. Execution of arbitrary code may be possible. A Denial of
Service (DoS) condition may also be caused.

--
Detailed Information:
Oracle databases may use a built-in procedure to assist in database
replication. The "repcat_import_check" procedure contains a
programming error that may allow an attacker to execute a buffer
overflow attack.

This overflow is triggered by a long string in some parameters for the
procedure.

If you are running Oracle on a Windows server, make sure that the
variable $ORACLE_PORTS is set to a value of "any".

--
Affected Systems:
        Oracle 9i

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can supply a long string to the "gowner" or "gname"
variable to cause the overflow. The result could permit the
attacker to gain escalated privileges and run code of their
choosing. This attack requires an attacker to logon to the
database with a valid username and password combination.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Ensure the system is using an up to date version of the software and has
had all vendor supplied patches applied.
