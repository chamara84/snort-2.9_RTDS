3148

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a
vulnerability in Microsoft Windows Help.

--
Impact:
Serious. Code execution is possible leading to unauthorized
administrative access to the target host.

--
Detailed Information:
Microsoft Windows Help can use ActiveX controls when dealing with
Windows Help files.

A programming error in the processing of a buffer that handles the
"item" parameter of a help file can lead to the exposure of a buffer
overflow condition. An attacker may be able to overflow this buffer and
supply code of their choosing to be executed on the system with the
privileges of the administrative account.

In addition, applications may treat Windows Help as a trusted program
and further exploitation and host firewall bypass may be possible.

--
Affected Systems:
	Systems using Microsoft Windows

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can overflow a buffer by inserting extra data into the input
parameter of a malicious help file. The attacker may then insert code of
their choosing to either run commands on the system or execute the code
with the privileges of the administrative account.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Ensure the system is using an up to date version of the software and has
had all vendor supplied patches applied.
