Rule:

--
Sid:
1365

--
Summary:
Attempted rm command access via web

--
Impact:
Attempt to delete files on a webserver.

--
Detailed Information:
This is an attempt to remove on a machine. Using this command an attacker may delete files on a machine.

--
Attack Scenarios:
The attacker can make a standard HTTP request that contains 'rm' in the URI which can then delete files present on the host.  This command may also be requested on a command line should the attacker gain access to the machine.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple HTTP request.

--
False Positives:

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:
Webservers should not be allowed to view or execute files and binaries outside of it's designated web root or cgi-bin.  Whenever possible, sensitive files and certain areas of the filesystem should have the system immutable flag set to negate the use of the rm command. On BSD derived systems, setting the systems runtime securelevel also prevents the securelevel from being changed. (note: the securelevel can only be increased)
