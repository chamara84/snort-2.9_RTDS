238

--
Summary:
This event is generated when a command is sent to a Tribal Flood Network
(TFN) Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) daemon.

--
Impact:
Attempted DDoS.  If the listed source IP is in your network, it may be a
TFN client.  If the listed destination IP is in your network, it may be 
a TFN daemon.

--
Detailed Information:
The TFN DDoS uses a tiered structure of compromised hosts to coordinate 
and participate in a distributed denial of service attack. Clients 
communicate with daemons to inform them to launch attacks.

This event is indicative of a client sending commands to a daemon.

--
Affected Systems:
Any TFN compromised host.

--
Attack Scenarios:
After a host becomes a TFN daemon, it will respond to client requests.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. TFN code is freely available.

--
False Positives:
None Known.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

--
Corrective Action:
Perform proper forensic analysis on the suspected compromised host to discover the means of compromise.

Rebuild a confirmed compromised host.

Use a packet-filtering firewall to block inappropriate traffic to the network to prevent hosts from being compromised.
