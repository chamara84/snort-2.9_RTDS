--
Impact:
Severe; this vulnerablity is remotely exploitable, and is present on systems that are widely deployed.
--
Detailed Information:
This rule detects an attacker executing the STAT command along with file globbing character '*'.  There is a vulnerability in Microsofts IIS 4.0, 5.0, and 5.1 servers,  that causes the service to crash once it receives the STAT command along with a large number of file globbing characters.  

VisNetic and Titan FTP servers are also vulnerable to an attack which can present the attacker with the opportunity to break out of the ftp root directory using this command.
