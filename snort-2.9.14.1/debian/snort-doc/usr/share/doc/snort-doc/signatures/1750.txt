Sid: 1750


--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a 
potential weakness on a host running Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS).

--
Impact:
Information gathering possible administrator access.

--
Detailed Information:
This event indicates that an attempt has been made to exploit 
potential weaknesses in a host running Microsoft IIS.

The attacker may be trying to gain information on the IIS implementation 
on the host, this may be the prelude to an attack against that host
using that information. Specifically, this event indicates an attempt to
retrieve the file "users.xml" which may contain username and password
information for the host.

--
Affected Systems:
	Any host using IIS.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can retrieve a sensitive file containing information on the IIS 
implementation. The attacker might then gain administrator access to the site, 
deface the content or gain access to a database.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None Known.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

--
Corrective Action:
Check the IIS implementation on the host. Ensure all measures have been taken 
to deny access to sensitive files.

Ensure that the IIS implementation is fully patched.

Ensure that the underlying operating system is fully patched.

Employ strategies to harden the IIS implementation and operating system.

Check the host for signs of compromise.
