Rule:

--
Sid:
2651

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known
vulnerability in a Oracle database implementation.

--
Impact:
Serious. Execution of arbitrary code may be possible. A Denial of
Service (DoS) condition may also be caused.

--
Detailed Information:
Oracle databases have a built-in functions NUMTOYMINTERVAL and
NUMTODSINTERVAL that are used to convert a number to an interval
year to month or interval day to second literal.

These functions contain a programming error that may allow an
attacker to execute a buffer overflow attack.

This overflow is triggered by a long string in the second parameter
of the function.

If you are running Oracle on a Windows server, make sure that the
variable $ORACLE_PORTS is set to a value of "any".

--
Affected Systems:
        Oracle 9i

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can supply a long string as a value for this command.
The result could permit the attacker to gain escalated privileges and
run code of their choosing. This attack requires an attacker to logon
to the database with a valid username and password combination.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Ensure the system is using an up to date version of the software and has
had all vendor supplied patches applied.
