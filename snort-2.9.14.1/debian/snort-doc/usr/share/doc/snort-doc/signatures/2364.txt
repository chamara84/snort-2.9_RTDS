2364

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to access a file that
has a known vulnerability in a PHP web application running on a server.

--
Impact:
Information gathering and system integrity compromise. Possible unauthorized
administrative access to the server or application. Possible execution
of arbitrary code of the attackers choosing in some cases.

--
Detailed Information:
This event is generated when an attempt is made access the file
options_form.php used in the PHP application Cyboards. Some applications do
not perform stringent checks when validating the credentials of a client
host connecting to the services offered on a host server. This can lead
to unauthorized access and possibly escalated privileges to that of the
administrator. Data stored on the machine can be compromised and trust
relationships between the victim server and other hosts can be exploited by the attacker.

If stringent input checks are not performed by the PHP application, it
may also be possible for an attacker to execute system binaries or
malicious code of the attackers choosing.

--
Affected Systems:
	Cyboards Cyboards PHP Lite 1.21
	Cyboards Cyboards PHP Lite 1.25

--
Attack Scenarios:
My manipulating certain variables contained in a PHP script an attacker
may be able to supply code of their choosing and execute it on the
server.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. No exploit software required.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Ensure the system is using an up to date version of the software and has
had all vendor supplied patches applied.
