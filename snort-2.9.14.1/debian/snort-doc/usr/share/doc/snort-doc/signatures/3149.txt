Sid:
3149

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a
vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer.

--
Impact:
Serious. Code execution is possible leading to unauthorized
administrative access to the target host.

--
Detailed Information:
Microsoft Internet Explorer uses the Object tag to identify ActiveX
controls sometimes used in web content.

A programming error in the processing of a buffer that handles the
"item" parameter of an object tag can lead to the exposure of a buffer
overflow condition. An attacker may be able to overflow this buffer and
supply code of their choosing to be executed on the system with the
privileges of the administrative account.

The procedure that checks the length of a buffer that handles the item
parameter may be bypassed by using the slash character either directly
or via encoding methods. This vulnerability may be exploited whenever
Internet Explorer is used to read HTML files.

--
Affected Systems:
	Systems using Microsoft Windows

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can overflow a buffer by inserting extra data into the input
parameter of a malicious html file. The attacker may then insert code of
their choosing to either run commands on the system or execute the code
with the privileges of the administrative account.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Ensure the system is using an up to date version of the software and has
had all vendor supplied patches applied.
