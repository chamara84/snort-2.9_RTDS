Sid:
1844

--
Summary:
This event is generated when a remote attacker sends an overly long
argument in the AUTHENTICATE command to an internal IMAP server,
indicating an attempt to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in
Netscape Messaging Server and University of Washington IMAP
implementations. This may also affect other IMAP server implementations.

--
Impact:
Remote execution of arbitrary code with the security privileges of the
IMAP process, possibly leading to remote root compromise.

--
Detailed Information:
A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the AUTHENTICATE command in
University of Washington IMAP and Netscape Messaging Server. This can
allow a remote attacker to send an AUTHENTICATE command with a
malformed, overlong argument to a vulnerable IMAP server, causing a
buffer overflow condition. The attacker can then execute arbitrary code
on the server with the security privileges of the IMAP server process. 

--
Affected Systems:
	Netscape Messaging Server 3.55 and earlier
	University of Washington imapd 10.234 and earlier.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker sends an overly long, malformed argument to an AUTHENTICATE
command to a vulnerable IMAP server, causing a buffer overflow
condition. The attacker is then able to execute arbitrary code on the
server with the security privileges of the IMAP server process.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploits exist.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Patches have been released for both UW IMAP and Netscape Messaging
Server. Apply the patch or upgrade to a Netscape Messaging Server
version higher than 3.55 or UW IMAP version higher than 10.234.
