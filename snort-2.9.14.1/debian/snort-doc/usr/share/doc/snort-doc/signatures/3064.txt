Attack Scenarios: 
The victim must first install the server. Be wary of suspicious files because
they often can be backdoors in disguise. 
Once the victim has unknowingly installed the server, the attacker will usually
employ an IP scanner tool to find vulnerable 
systems. Once an IP is found, the attacker simply has to make the connection.
-- 

Ease of Attack: 
Easy. Simply a matter of pressing the connect button once the victim has
installed the server.

Corrective Action:

Delete the registry key Reg32=Registry32.exe found in

Delete Registry32.exe from Win.ini and System.ini
If found, delete Registry32.exe and server.exe
Make sure to keep your virus definitions updated on your anti-virus software.
