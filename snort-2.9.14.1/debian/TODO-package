TODO for Snort's packaging
--------------------------

- Move to dpkg format v3. We have only a few changes in the source
  package so that should be easy to do.

- Make it possible for admins to provide more than one interface Snort will
  listen to when configuring the package

- Make it easier to do changes in maintainer's config files if different 
  'flavors' are provided (with different compilation flags). Although
  currently there is one flavor of the snort package, if different flavors
  are generated they might duplicate a lot of common code which makes it
  unmaintainable and leads to bugs.
  
  For example, when the database flavor packages were provided (snort-pgsql and
  snort-mysql) bugs (e.g. #502084) might be fixed in the basic flavor but
  not in other packages.

  --> This might require that the generation of the
  /etc/snort/snort.debian.conf configuration file and its handling (through
  scripts common for all packages) should be moved over to snort-common (along
  with all of the questions and templates)

- Share information between package installations. If a user installs the
  basic 'snort' package and later on a different snort-xxx 'flavor' 
  (e.g. with inline support) he will be asked the same questions (interface, IP
  range) twice. Maybe use snort-common as a placeholder for shared information.
  Also simplifies code sharing between config files

  --> Fixes the above.
